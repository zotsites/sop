    "content": "# Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship for Excellence in Research\n### **UCI (Big 7 Pre-Application) Mandatory Advising Deadline****:**\n#### **October 29, 2019 at 12:00 noon Pacific Time for Fall 2020 funding  \n**\n**Access Step 1, the[Goldwater Student Profile and Pre-Application,](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/steps-in-process/) between September and October annually to begin the mandatory advising process.**\n**After submitting your Pre-Application, please complete Step 2, our[Goldwater Advising Questionnaire](https://scout.eee.uci.edu/s/19-20Goldwater).**  \n**  \n**\n#### **Overview**\nThe Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship provides 1 to 2 years of undergraduate funding to advance excellence in mathematics, natural sciences, and computer sciences or engineering, and to protect U.S. leadership in science and technology by educating and training new generations equipped to meet ever-increasing challenges.\nFunding begins in Fall Quarter of the junior or senior year, for outstanding students of promise who demonstrate strong commitment to a research career in eligible Fields of Study and display intellectual intensity in natural sciences, mathematics or engineering, including the evidence of potential for a significant future contribution to research in their chosen field. The scholarship is administered by the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Fund, established by Congress to help alleviate a critical shortage of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.\n#### **Who is Eligible**\nCandidates must:\n  * Be sophomores (two years of full-time undergraduate study remaining) or juniors (one year of study remaining);\n  * Be U.S. citizens, U.S. Nationals, or Permanent Residents who intend to obtain U.S. citizenship;\n  * Have a minimum 3.0+ GPA (3.7+ recommended);\n  * Have selected a major and demonstrate outstanding potential for a career in mathematics, the natural sciences, psychological research, computer science, or those engineering disciplines which contribute significantly to the technological advances of the U.S.\n\n\nA detailed list of eligible Fields of Study is available on the Goldwater website, under [Eligibility](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/eligibility/).  _Please also note: Students who plan to study medicine are eligible if they plan a career in research, rather than a career as _practicing physician with emphasis on the clinical practice of medicine and patient care_. Psychology applicants must be pursuing research inquiry that would be considered to be in the natural sciences.  \n_\nGoldwater Scholars typically intend to pursue doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in the disciplines the Foundation supports. Students who aspire to a Master\u2019s degree or teaching credential are generally not competitive.\nTo be competitive for campus endorsement (nomination), SOP advisors recommend that applicants achieve at least a 3.7 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of noteworthy accomplishment, professional competence, and dedication to ambitious career goals in academia, government or nonprofit research institutes, or private-sector research & development.\nRelevant qualifications may include completion of a significant amount of coursework relating to the proposed Field of Study; 1 or more years of research experience; evidence of significant research achievements, such as publications, presentations, patents, or software applications; and/or significant work experience/internships relevant to the selected research area. Abilities and potential may also be demonstrated by independent investigation of theory or issues related to the Field of Study, involvement in science-related student organizations, early participation in graduate courses, and other accomplishments outside the classroom.\nPlease note that external scholarship agencies will consider all of your credit-bearing coursework from any college or institution as part of the review process (including CSU, community colleges, private colleges or other UC campuses/Extension programs, and including units earned while in high school). Grades from other colleges will be included in calculation of your overall GPA for eligibility purposes.\n#### **SOP Required Advising Process  \n**\n**Campus endorsement (nomination) is a required component** of the Goldwater Scholarship application. You may NOT apply directly to the Goldwater Foundation. Working with SOP staff advisors during Fall quarter to produce a competitive fellowship application is mandatory.\nTo begin the SOP advising process, in late October, sophomores and juniors complete a two-step Pre-Application process, including submission of the **[Goldwater Student Profile and Pre-Application](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/steps-in-process/)** and the **[Goldwater Advising Questionnaire](https://scout.eee.uci.edu/s/19-20Goldwater)**.\nIn early November, SOP staff review Pre-Applications, determine whether you are eligible for the scholarship and the Field of Study you have chosen, and meet with potential applicants to discuss their candidacy and subsequent steps. Eligible candidates will receive an invitation to join our Big 7 Canvas Course, where you will find prompts, deadlines, and detailed instructions for how to prepare the following application first-draft materials, which will be used in the nomination review committee meeting.\nAll candidates submit:\n  * Goldwater Student Profile and Pre-Application\n  * Application forms, including detailed short answers about research experiences, graduate program interests, and career goals\n  * 1 3-page Research Essay, typically based on a past or current research experience (for prompt, see [Goldwater: Steps in Application Process](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/steps-in-process/))\n  * Transcripts of all college coursework\n  * Copy of the nominee\u2019s Permanent Resident card and letter of intent to become U.S. citizen, if nominee\u2019s citizenship status is permanent resident.\n  * 3 Letters of Recommendation, typically including one from the Principal Investigator or other supervisor of a research experience; and two from science faculty and instructors who can discuss your past research experiences; potential for a research career in mathematics, the natural sciences, or engineering; and academic performance in coursework in your major or a related field.\n\n\n**Recommenders should provide signed letters on letterhead directly to SOP** by email at [sklrship@uci.edu](mailto:sklrship@uci.edu), campus mail (zot code 5695), or dropped off in person at our office (193 Science Library, in the Writing Center). Letters will be due on **November 26, 2019** for consideration in the campus endorsement (nomination) process.  _Graduate students or other research mentors not holding doctoral degrees who are writing letters for Goldwater candidates should approach Principal Investigators for co-signature._**  \n**\nIn December, SOP convenes a screening panel composed of deans and faculty in Goldwater\u2019s eligible Fields of Study. The faculty panel may nominate up to four candidates admitted to UCI as freshmen and one additional transfer student. UCI nomination is extremely competitive.\nUp to 4 nominees admitted to UCI as freshmen, and 1 nominated transfer student, will receive detailed feedback for revision of their materials in mid-December, and work closely with staff advisors in December and January to prepare a final revision for submission to Goldwater.\nIn January, SOP formally submits nominated, complete application materials, including all references and supporting documents.\n#### **Selection Procedures**\nThe Foundation writes, \u201cThe mission of the Goldwater program is straightforward \u2013 we seek to identify and support college sophomores and juniors who show exceptional promise of becoming this Nation\u2019s next generation of natural sciences, mathematics and engineering research leaders. When reviewing nomination packets, Goldwater reviewers are attempting to determine who these individuals are among the nominees. Goldwater reviewers seek to identify undergraduates who demonstrate a passion for doing research and who exhibit the creative spark that will make them leaders in their fields.\u201d\nThrough a partnership with the Department of Defense, the Goldwater Foundation has recently been able to increase the number of scholarships awarded from approximately 260 to 450 scholarships per year. In addition, as of 2019, the Foundation announced that applications will now be reviewed by academic discipline, rather than conducting initial screening by U.S. state of residence.\nIn addition to displaying excellent academic backgrounds (in practice, a minimum 3.7 GPA) and evidence of other talents or interesting experiences, winners have well-written, carefully developed research essays and very strong letters composed by faculty. At UCI, between 2014-2019, all competitive applicants expressed ambition to earn a doctoral degree (including Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.), and had a mean of 1.875 years of research experience, as well as a mean of 1.33 poster presentations and 1.5 oral presentations completed, at the time of application. Most honorees participated in both the Campuswide Honors Program (now, the Campuswide Honors Collegium) and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. While applicants were competitive for invitation to School-based Honors Programs or Excellence in Research in Biological Sciences, invitation to these senior-year programs typically occurs after Goldwater nominations are submitted (and thus cannot be factored into selection).\n#### Recent Recipients & Honorable Mentions\n  * In 2021, two UCI students received Goldwater Scholarships: **Pratyush Muthukumar** (Computer Science) and **Lucy Yang** (Chemistry and Biological Sciences).\n  * In 2018, Aaron Chau (Public Health Sciences) and Christian Totoiu (Chemical Engineering) received Honorable Mentions.\n  * In 2017, Leandra Jackson (Public Health Sciences) won a Goldwater scholarship and Jordan Edmunds (Electrical Engineering; Biological Sciences) received an honorable mention.\n  * In 2016, Joshua Cook (Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry) won a Goldwater scholarship and Jordan Edmunds (Electrical Engineering) received an honorable mention.\n  * In 2009-2010, two UCI students won Goldwater Scholarships: Yas Sanaiha (Biology) and Kevin Slagle (Physics).\n\n\n#### **Finances**\nEach scholarship covers eligible expenses for tuition, fees, books, and room and board, up to a maximum of $7,500 annually. Scholarship monies not used during one academic year are not transferable to the succeeding academic year. Sophomore scholarship winners are eligible for a maximum of two years of scholarship support, and junior scholarship recipients are eligible for a maximum of one year of scholarship support.\n#### **Comments**\nGoldwater is an outstanding scholarship for students who intend research careers in engineering, computer science, mathematics or the natural sciences. Learning effective grant-writing skills to apply for this highly competitive, merit-based award often serves as an important catalyst for future academic achievements and honors, including prestigious graduate scholarships such as the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship or the Churchill Scholarship; here, we should extol the subseqent successes of Ms. Jackson, who went on to receive the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, and Mr. Edmunds, who received the Hertz Fellowship.\n#### For More Information\nFurther information and Pre-Applications are available at [the Goldwater website](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/).\nQuestions about the campus advising and endorsement (nomination) process may be directed to the Scholarship Opportunities Program at 949-824-0189 or [scholars@uci.edu](mailto:scholars@uci.edu).\n**SOP is able to advise competitive undergraduate candidates at UC Irvine only.**\n## Related Posts\n[Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\n##  [Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\nJan 5, 2022\nUCI (Big 7 Pre-Application) Mandatory Advising Deadline: November 14, 2019 at 12:00 noon Pacific Time for Fall 2020...\n[The Harry S.

The scholarship was created at the request of Sir Winston Churchill to help American students study at Cambridge.\n**Eligibility**  \nUndergraduates who are U.S. citizens may apply. Begin the process during the spring before your final year on campus by submitting a Pre-Application. Current seniors or recent UCI alumni may also apply. You must finish your bachelor\u2019s degree before enrollment. However, you do NOT need to have earned a bachelor\u2019s degree by the time you apply.\nPlease note that external scholarship agencies will consider all of your credit-bearing coursework from any college or institution as part of the review process (including CSU, community colleges, private colleges or other UC campuses/Extension programs, and including units earned while in high school). Grades from other colleges will be included in calculation of your overall GPA for eligibility purposes.\nRecent recipients have had exceptional academic achievement with a 3.9+ GPA and demonstrate professional competence and dedication to the field of study through publications and presentations, leadership or mentoring roles in academic or service organizations, and/or significant work experience/internships related to the major.\nFurthermore, a candidate for the Churchill scholarship must also display a \u201cproven talent in research and a capacity to contribute to the advancement of knowledge\u201d through the pursuance of \u201coriginal, creative work at an advanced level.\u201d This may be demonstrated through research, science-focused awards and prizes, and letters of recommendation. An ideal applicant is also committed to and excelling in other activities (such as music, athletics, or community service) outside of their academic interests.\n**UCI may nominate two students annually for funding consideration at the national level.**\n**Selection Procedure**  \nWorking with SOP advisors is mandatory, as campus nomination is required. To begin the SOP advising process, juniors, graduating seniors, and alumni within 1 year of graduation complete a [Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/). In April and May, SOP staff review Pre-Applications and meet with potential applicants to discuss their candidacy and subsequent steps. For detailed information about each stage of the application process \u2014 including the roles of campus endorsement and evaluation \u2014 please view the [Application Process Overview](http://wp.due.uci.edu/sop/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2017/09/2017-Application-Process-Overview-Churchill.pdf).\nAfter completing the Pre-App and meeting with SOP staff to discuss your candidacy, you will work on drafts of your application and receive strategic coaching from SOP staff. As time permits, SOP staff may also offer advising to your recommendation letter writers. For detailed information about each stage of the application process, please view the [Application Process Overview](http://sites.uci.edu/sopcandidates/files/2018/03/2018-Application-Process-Overview-Schwarzman-FINAL.docx).\nChurchill scholarship applications are submitted in two parts:\nFirst, the applicant is responsible for submitting his/her Cambridge graduate application for admission, including two academic letters of recommendation and transcripts, to Cambridge University by mid-October (exact date not yet established). The Churchill Scholarship Committee will not review your Cambridge application in determining your scholarship award. Please note that you must check Churchill College as your first choice on the Cambridge application. Please treat the Churchill application as a stand-alone document (thus the need for separate letters of recommendation and transcripts). However, the Scholarship Opportunities Program requires a copy of your Cambridge application prior to submission.\nSecondly, you must submit to the SOP a complete Churchill Scholarship application to be considered for UC Irvine endorsement, which the Churchill Foundation requires candidates to obtain to move forward in the competition. All materials (including letters) must be submitted to the SOP. These consist of the application form and personal statement, a one-page listing of scholarships and awards, and a one-page listing of research experiences, internships, and publications, transcripts from all colleges attended, and 4 academic letters of reference.\nTwo of the academic letters of recommendation for the Scholarship application will presumably will be from the same letter writers who wrote letters supporting your Cambridge University application. However, each of the four letters must be written specifically for the Churchill Scholarship and accompanied by the official Churchill reference cover sheet that the applicant has signed (the letter writers may not just use a copy of the letter they provided for admission to Cambridge). Letters should be written to the attention of the \u201cChurchill Scholarship Selection Committee\u201d and be specifically tailored toward your application as a Churchill Scholar. Referees will submit these letters to the SOP directly.\nThe UCI Churchill committee will interview candidates to determine whether their applications have earned campus endorsement (nomination). The University will endorse up to two candidates whom the Committee feels have the potential to be Churchill Scholars and will offer feedback for refining the application before submission to the Churchill Foundation for funding consideration. The SOP will write comprehensive nomination letters for each endorsed candidate and will send your complete application materials (including reference letters) and the nomination letter to the Churchill Foundation.\n**Recent Recipients and Selection Procedures**  \nThe national Churchill Foundation Scholarship Screening Committee, comprising former Churchill Scholars, evaluates the applications and very selectively endorses those considered most qualified for a scholarship. Shortlisted candidates will be scheduled, usually in the second week of January, for a phone interview with the Director of the Foundation.\nThe Cambridge Board of Graduate Studies and the appropriate department at Cambridge also review the applications of nationally endorsed candidates, consider the availability of appropriate supervision and laboratory space, and decide who is eligible for admission to the University. Based on this information, the Winston Churchill Foundation makes final decisions on Churchill Scholarship winners and announces them by mid-March (though in recent years, this was completed by March 1). Approximately 15 students receive funding each year.\n**Finances**  \nA yearlong scholarship for approximately $60,000 total. It covers all tuition fees (currently about $40,000). Students also receive a living allowance based on the duration of the program (\u00a314,777 if enrolled in a twelve-month program). A travel allowance of up to $1,500 will also be granted, as well as a $500 supplement for visa and health reimbursement. There is also a possible Special Research Grant of up to $2,000 which will cover travel for presentations at international conferences, short stays at another university or institute for special research, and other activities.\n**For more information**  \nPlease visit [the Churchill Scholarship website](https://www.churchillscholarship.org/).\n**Access the[Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/) between late February \u2013 early April annually to begin the application process.**\n**SOP is able to advise competitive undergraduate candidates at UC Irvine only.**\n## Related Posts\n[Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\n##  [Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\nJan 5, 2022\nUCI (Big 7 Pre-Application) Mandatory Advising Deadline: November 14, 2019 at 12:00 noon Pacific Time for Fall 2020...\n[The Harry S.

    "content": "# Knight-Hennessy Scholarship at Stanford University\n### About\nThe [Knight-Hennessy Scholars](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program) program cultivates a diverse, multidisciplinary community of emerging leaders from around the world and guides them to collaborate, innovate, and communicate as they prepare to address the complex challenges facing society.\nKnight-Hennessy Scholars become part of a supportive family of fellow scholars. Through the King Global Leadership Program, scholars will broaden knowledge, develop skills, and strengthen character; this platform provides a collection of community experiences, workshops, meetings with leaders, domestic and global study trips, and personal development opportunities. Knight-Hennessy Scholars also receive funding for graduate study at Stanford University.\nAddressing some of the most important problems that the world faces today around the environment, healthcare, education, inequality, and social justice requires leadership with multidisciplinary and multicultural understanding. As a Knight-Hennessy Scholar, you will develop both the depth and range of subject expertise to confront the intractable challenges and opportunities of the future. You will be part of a unique community of change agents from a diverse range of backgrounds. This is a community that will support and motivate you at Stanford and beyond.\n### Fields of Study\nKnight-Hennessy places no restrictions on academic field of study or career aspirations. All Knight-Hennessy Scholars have to apply to and be accepted by a graduate program at Stanford at the same time they apply to Knight-Hennessy Scholars. Your graduate program will be your primary affiliation, and the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program will provide you with access to an additional community and opportunities tailored to scholars.\nYou are eligible to apply to the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program if you are applying to enroll in a full-time graduate program(s) at Stanford (for example, but not limited to, DMA, JD, MA, MBA, MD, MFA, MPP, MS, or PhD) or if you plan on pursuing one of Stanford\u2019s many joint- and dual- graduate degree options (for example, but not limited to, MD+PhD, JD+MA, MBA+MS). You should check each graduate program\u2019s website for a sense of what it seeks in candidates. You must meet the requirements for admission to your home graduate program.\nKnight-Hennessy gives priority to applicants who will spend at least two years at Stanford. We do not believe one year is sufficient to form the community we envision and benefit from the leadership platform we are developing.\nIn the 2018 and 2019 cohorts, 40% of Scholars were pursuing PhD degrees, 37% were pursuing professional degrees (i.e. Business, Law, Medicine), and 23% were pursuing master\u2019s degrees(i.e. MPP, MA, MS). Scholarships were awarded for completion of 53 degree programs at Stanford\u2019s Schools, including Humanities and Sciences (27%), Engineering (22%), Medicine (16%), Law (15%), Business (12%), Education (6%), and Earth Sciences (2%).\n### Eligibility\nSOP advises currently enrolled juniors (intending to graduate next academic year); graduating seniors (in the current academic year); and recent alumni (who graduated within the most recent academic year). If you are still in college studying for your first bachelor\u2019s degree, you are eligible to apply as long as you will complete your first bachelor\u2019s degree before you enroll as a graduate student at Stanford. If you hold a previous degree, please consult the [Eligibility](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/admission/eligibility) section on the Knight-Hennessy Scholars website for more information.\nThere are no citizenship restrictions. The Knight-Hennessy Scholars program expects that over time about one-third of Scholars will be from the U.S., and about two thirds will be from countries outside the U.S. Those numbers will fluctuate from year to year, since the goal is to admit the world\u2019s very best students, regardless of location. Undocumented students are eligible to apply for the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program, but must meet eligibility for the graduate program, including any work requirements. For more information, please visit [undocumented.stanford.edu](http://undocumented.stanford.edu/).\nThe Knight-Hennessy Scholars program does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, applicants should have at least a **3.7 GPA** , and for many Stanford graduate programs, a 3.9+ GPA and significantly above-average test scores (such as GRE, MCAT, LSAT or GMAT) will also be necessary to achieve admissions. Applicants must also be able to demonstrate professional competence and dedication to the field of study through leadership or founding roles in academic or service organizations, entrepreneurial ventures, publications or performances, and/or significant work experience/internships related to the major.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThrough the **King Global Leadership Program (KGLP)** you will build on your graduate degree program to expand knowledge, develop skills, and strengthen character. As a Knight-Hennessy Scholar, you will learn to communicate, collaborate, and innovate with your fellow scholars from other disciplines. We believe these relationships \u2014 breaking down traditional academic silos \u2014 will be essential to your ability to discover new solutions that will advance humanity. The elements of KGLP will hone your capacity for collaborative leadership. You will gain a better understanding of yourself and others, allowing you to influence and lead better.\n**Denning House** is not a residence but serves as your convening hub, enabling our community of scholars to share ideas and experiences. The building is a dedicated space for ongoing interaction with each other, distinguished visitors, and, eventually, program alumni. The building, located in the heart of campus overlooking Lake Lagunita, features small-group spaces, a lounge (with snacks), classrooms, meeting, lecture and discussion rooms, and a dining space that can accommodate one class of scholars \u2013 up to 100 people \u2013 when we gather for regular dinners.\n**Scholarship:** During each of the first three years of graduate study, Knight-Hennessy Scholars receive:\n  * a fellowship applied directly to cover tuition and associated fees, for any graduate degree(s) at Stanford to which you are admitted at the time you are selected as a scholar;\n  * a stipend for living and academic expenses (such as room and board, books, academic supplies, instructional materials, local transportation, and reasonable personal expenses);\n  * a travel grant intended to cover an economy-class ticket for one annual trip to and from Stanford.\n  * If your degree program exceeds three years \u2014 such as an MD or PhD program, or a Stanford dual- or joint-degree program \u2014 then your Stanford home department(s) will fund the remainder of your education to the extent consistent with its standard funding commitment for that program. (This means, for example, that your program may fund you for one additional year for some PhDs and three additional years for others.)\n  * Knight-Hennessy Scholars also may access supplemental funds to support academic enrichment (e.g., conference travel). Moreover, if you engage in optional research projects during the summer, the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program may provide summer funding, through separate application. In addition, Knight-Hennessy Scholars pursuing positive impact through social ventures may be eligible to apply for seed funding.\n\n\n### Competitiveness\nIn 2020, 76 Knight-Hennessy Scholars were selected from 6,171 applications. The primary selection criteria used to evaluate applicants were **independence of thought** , **purposeful leadership** , and a **civic mindset**.\nKnight-Hennessy is a fantastic, if highly competitive, opportunity for students whose ambitious career goals are a good fit with Stanford\u2019s graduate majors and who seek to actively collaborate with an interdisciplinary, international cohort of scholars to work on major global problems.\nWe should note as well that Stanford\u2019s doctoral programs typically fully fund at least three years for their students, regardless of whether you receive the Knight-Hennessy scholarship. Students who are applying for Ph.D. programs at Stanford and want to become Knight-Hennessy Scholars should demonstrate excellence in research, as well as be able to demonstrate the capacity for positive social change in the practical sense, beyond knowledge-building contributions that have indirect social impacts.\n## Related Posts\n[Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/paul-daisy-soros-fellowship-for-new-americans/)\n##  [Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/paul-daisy-soros-fellowship-for-new-americans/)\nMay 25, 2022\nAbout The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans is a $90,000 merit-based fellowship exclusively for...\n[Harry S.

She hopes to apply to a graduate program in International Relations next year, and continue to find opportunities to live and work abroad._\n**What did you study at UCI and how did it inspire you to pursue a Fulbright?**\nI graduated from UCI in 2014, and as an undergraduate I majored in international studies with a Spanish minor. I spent my junior year studying abroad in Chile, and that was really the experience that set off my interest in international relations and living abroad. The time in Chile really inspired me to pursue a Fulbright.\n[Torres del Paine national park in Chile](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/Eliza-Mountain-top.jpg)\n**How was your Chile experience influential?**\nWhile I was abroad in Chile, I took classes at a local university and I was also working on my senior thesis on Peruvian immigration to Chile. One of my [Campuswide Honors Program](http://honors.uci.edu/) advisors said I should consider applying to the Fulbright. So I looked into it, and realized that my experience studying abroad in a Latin American region could boost my application and chances, so I looked into those possibilities, and ultimately decided to apply for a Fulbright doing research in Nicaragua.\nIt was really my study abroad that inspired me to pursue it and so I spent a summer after graduation in D.C. doing an internship with a nonprofit in UCDC, and then I spent 10 months in Nicaragua involved in civic engagement. I soon found out that doing research in Nicaragua would be quite different from my study abroad experience. In Nicaragua, it would just be me, and it definitely was a more independent experience.\n**Tell me a little bit about how you described your project when applying for the Fulbright. How did you build a case for travel? Why go on location to Nicaragua and what did you want to accomplish there?**\nI picked the region before I picked the project. I had been in Chile before and in the context of Latin America, I would say that Chile is on a different economic spectrum. There are so many variances within Latin American countries and so I looked for a unique country that would offer me a more viable and realistic option to be awarded the Fulbright.\nSome countries can be quite competitive. I looked into possibilities regarding research, with an eye for specific themes that interested me, like civic engagement. This topic is at the center of important debates in central America, and within Nicaragua, and so I crafted my project around that topic. I decided to look into the process for obtaining national ID cards, which Nicaraguans use for voting, opening bank accounts and applying for employment. One of the most interesting aspects to me was exploring the reasons behind the Nicaraguan early voting age of 16.\nI wanted to explore that a little more. Why was their voting age so young? During my study abroad experience, the study abroad director in Chile was important in inspiring my proposal. He was the one I would talk to regarding how to choose a country, and weigh out the pros and cons because every country in the Fulbright program is a little different. They have different requirements. Given my academic background and experiences, Nicaragua seemed like the most viable option.\n**This was a professor in Chile who helped you brainstorm and prepare the background study for research in Nicaragua?**\nHe was my director of study abroad. He was actually a UCSB professor who was doing a 2-year contract as the director of the Chile program. He was really helpful, as was my thesis advisor at UCI who was immensely helpful as well. He was especially good at asking questions: _what does this mean? Can you clarify this?_\nMy honors\u2019 advisor, too, offered guidance and support and was one of the individuals who helped write the letters of rec, and helped plant the seed.\n**So, when did the seed get planted? Was it at UCI? Was it in Chile?**\nI was in the Campuswide Honors Program when I was an undergraduate and I remember the end of my sophomore year hearing about 2 people in the honors program who had gotten a Fulbright. And I thought, _that seems interesting_ , and then it didn\u2019t cross my mind for a while until I was in Chile for my senior year when my honors\u2019 advisor contacted me and said, _have you considered a Fulbright?_\n**How did SOP help you navigate the application process?**\nThe process is pretty long. I looked through the website to find all the different resources. The pre-application deadline was in April and the campus deadline was August, so at first, I was pretty overwhelmed.\nI found that the SOP online resources were so helpful. I spent a whole summer dedicated full-time to applying for the Fulbright, which led to the endorsement interview on campus in August.\nSOP has a lot of resources on their website, and they are really on top of things. It was a grueling process but SOP was really good about having me submit multiple drafts of my project statement, personal statement and even my letters of recommendation were carefully read. They even suggested that I ask the director of the Honors Program to write a letter on my behalf. They discussed strategies for asking the right recommenders to increase my chances.\nI believe that the endorsements were ultimately what allowed me to get the Fulbright. I cannot imagine applying at-large. I think I would be so overwhelmed and not know where to begin.\n**Tell me a little bit more about your experiences in Nicaragua. What happened when you first arrived? Where did you stay? What was a day in your life like? Who did you meet?**\nIt was a little bit overwhelming at first. I stayed in the capital of Managua. When I applied for the Fulbright, I had to get a letter of affiliation from the host organization. If you are granted the award, these would be the organizations on the ground that would support you on location. My host institution was the [Martin Luther King Institute at the Polytechnic University](https://www.upoli.edu.ni/dependencias/ver/tipo:instituto-y-o-centro/dependencia:imlk). They were really my main point of contact from day 1.\n[My research group at Martin Luther King Institute,](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/11018341_1618540678391515_6023478401898918636_n.jpg)\nThey actually picked me up at the airport. They brought me to their office, gave me my office space, and introduced me to the staff. I think that people don\u2019t realize that a 10-month grant may sound like a long time, but it\u2019s not. When you are actually there, it goes by so fast, especially when you are trying to execute a full-blown project.\n**How did you break down the project into doable parts? What role did the host organization play?**\nThe first 3 months were really spent establishing contacts. My host reached out on my behalf telling the community, _we have someone doing a research project_ ; _she\u2019d love to set up an interview_ , and so for the first half, I interviewed with local civic organizations working in the electoral process and committed to transparency. I interviewed them asking them a lot of questions about the purpose of the national ID card for Nicaraguans; what was it used for? What are the obstacles to obtaining this? What are some issues behind it?\n**The importance of getting multiple perspectives**\nI always tried to make sure to interview people from different backgrounds because it definitely was more of a controversial topic, so I had to make sure that I was capturing different backgrounds. I interviewed a few young people from different political parties and actually from the Sandinista party, which is the party in power, and got to hear their perspective. And then, I interviewed a couple of other people from different political parties and understood what the different views were in respect to youth voting and the level of engagement and factors that might affect people\u2019s engagement in society.\nThen, the second half was more of a focus group approach, so I worked with a local contact and she was great because she worked with a lot of youth groups\u2013young adults from ages 16 to their early 20\u2019s\u2013and we held a series of focus groups where I asked them questions, such as, _what does it mean to be young in Nicaragua? What was your process for obtaining the national ID card?_\nSome of them shared their personal experiences with going and obtaining these cards and getting their right to vote. I found that the focus groups gave them a chance to interact with their peers in a more informal setting as opposed to 1-1 interviews that can be a little intimidating.\n[Eliza posing with a colleague and the magazine the institute publishes.](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/10410304_10152721666192245_2243324117028529798_n.jpg)\n**What did you learn as a result of this project?**\nI came into the project at an interesting time. Soon after I started, I found out that the president had actually changed the constitution and introduced new dynamics. In short, the impact of the ID card had to do with the region. Among the challenges for obtaining one, research showed that there were economic barriers; it actually cost money to get the card. Spending a whole day to get the card, taking time out of work, and when people live day to day, they don\u2019t think about political engagement, so economics were a big factor. This, in turn, played into a lot of other categories. You may not have access to higher education, for example. There are so many layers to it.\n**Were there other Fulbrighters in the area?**\nThere were 2 others that also went during my year, but they were in different regions. One went north of the capital, to Matagalpa, to do research on coffee farming; the other was way off in the Atlantic coast. We were all in different regions, but I did get to see them once or twice during a briefing or when they came to the capital for a conference. We met for coffee and talked about our research.\n[Posing with friends after my Nicaraguan friend's thesis defense.](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/11183358_10155458022520290_5271964940730416394_n.jpg)\n**How comfortable are you with Spanish?**\nI\u2019m fluent. It definitely helped to go to Chile for a year. I became fluent in Chilean Spanish and in Nicaragua, people were surprised. The stereotype is that Americans don\u2019t speak very good Spanish, so they would ask, _where are you from? Are you from Spain?_\nHaving that experience in Chile and being confident in Spanish was so helpful in Nicaragua because there are situations when you have to be on your toes and having that local language adds an extra layer of comfort.\n**Did you feel safe?**\nYes. I would tell students, you have to be aware of your surroundings. Managua is a big city, but I never had any issues. The biggest thing was talking to locals, especially other women. They would tell me, it\u2019s okay to go here. They would give me advice on taking a taxi, for example, or what places to avoid after dark or general advice. I never felt unsafe but I also knew how to be cautious.\n**What advice would you give someone contemplating doing a Fulbright in South or Central America?**\nI talked a lot about research, but the Fulbright, more than anything, is a cultural exchange. They are looking for an individual who is open-minded, flexible, open to other cultures, who can engage with other cultures and can be a cultural ambassador to the US because the Fulbright program is funded by the Department of State.\nIt is seen almost as a citizen-diplomacy program. I would tell students, even if you don\u2019t necessarily have experience in South America think of ways in which you can show how you\u2019d be a good cultural ambassador. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really important and maybe if they consider teaching, and they have teaching experience, bringing that experience to light, that would help. Or if they are looking at research, and they\u2019ve done research on a certain topic, even if it\u2019s in another region, it can still be relevant to South America. I would bring that up, too.\n**How can you convey in a personal statement, research proposal or teaching statement that you are all these things, open-minded, culturally aware, diverse, how does that come across?**\nI think there are two components to the Fulbright. I can\u2019t speak as much to the ETA, since I did research, but I definitely would say, don\u2019t discredit your personal statement. That\u2019s really your place to tell your narrative. You start with sharing your experiences that demonstrate your cultural adaptability and your interest in the program because the Fulbright is not like any other program where you get a grant and focus on what it can do for you.\nThey are really looking for that mutual exchange. In my personal statement, I shared a lot about my experience in Chile, where I went, how I learned a lot, but I also discussed what I shared with locals there and emphasized that I built lasting friendships after my time in Chile. That\u2019s what they are looking for, too. They are looking for someone who builds lasting connections.\n**Have you stayed in touch with people in Nicaragua?**\nI have. My host institution actually publishes a magazine and it\u2019s all in Spanish but they write their abstract in English and they still send me pieces to translate from Spanish into English. They recently wrote a card inviting Angelina Jolie to their institution because they are interested in her work as a UN Peace Ambassador, and the mission of the institute I affiliated with was trying to create a culture of peace, so I translated that letter for them.\n**When you returned how did you connect with the DC opportunity?**\nWhen I did UCDC the summer after graduation, I was bitten by the DC bug. I wanted to move out here for work, and I actually found my current position through a staffing agency. My current position was supposed to be a month contract and luckily, they hired me full-time.\n**Are you working with the Fulbright program?**\nI\u2019ve been back in D.C. for about a year and half. I\u2019m actually working for the [Institute of International Education](http://www.cies.org/). The program focuses on senior level professors and professionals who are going to exchanges abroad. The interesting aspect of this job is that it allows me to work on it from the other side. I\u2019m with the scholar program.\nThe student program is based in the New York office, but the DC office works with the scholars, and I\u2019m actually working on programs with the [Europe-Eurasia region](http://www.cies.org/region/europe-eurasia), which is a new region for me. I\u2019ve had so much experience with Latin America, and I\u2019m now learning about all these countries in Europe and the priorities for those countries as far as research and teaching, so it\u2019s been a really interesting and growing experience.\n**How would you say the student and the scholar Fulbright programs differ?**\nI would say the student program is everything leading up to the Ph.D. and so the student program can be anything from recently graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree to still doing their dissertation and so they tend to be earlier on in their career. The scholar program is everything from recently received the Ph.D., onward, so we have everything from post-doctoral scholars to scholars distinguished in their fields and there are so many awards in the scholars program; some are teaching, some are doing research and some a combination of both which they can do through a visiting professorship at a university to an institution. Fulbright offers lots of opportunities for exchange.\nIt has definitely been life-transformative for me, and I encourage everyone to apply.\nEliza documented her Fulbright experience in Nicaragua.

His family was under the constant threat of deportation back to the refugee camp in Lebanon where they had come from. His parents, lacking strong educations themselves, could not help Mohamad with his school work, but always served as his role models and inspiration.\nGrowing up, Mohamad spent his summers visiting family in the Beddawi refugee camp in Lebanon, where resources for health care were inadequate. He watched family members struggle with ailments that should have been easily curable, but instead persisted and grew worse. This experience motivated Mohamad to pursue an education in bioengineering, however he felt limited by the range of education options available to him. A world of education options opened up to him when, his senior year, after a ten-year waiting process, his family\u2019s application to the United States was approved. Mohamad was able to pursue a degree in bioengineering at UC Irvine where President Obama distinguished him during a commencement address as someone who knows, \u201cwhat it means to dream.\u201d\nAt UC Irvine, he worked on building diagnostic devices for rural areas by designing computers that run on air instead of electricity. Later, he investigated the robustness of bacterial genetic circuits with respect to noise. Recently, Mohamad received the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, recognizing him as one of the future leaders in his field.\nMohamad is now pursuing a PhD in bioengineering at Caltech. The long-term goal of his scientific career is to develop tools for non-invasive modulation of brain circuitry, which would allow scientists to understand and treat neurological and psychiatric diseases that involve the dysfunction of local neural circuits. [Biography by Mohamad Abedi as posted in the Paul and Daisy Soros Foundation\u2019s Meet the Fellows](https://www.pdsoros.org/meet-the-fellows/mohamad-abedi) section.\n**What was your major at UCI, and how did you learn about the SOROS and the NSF?**\nWhen I first transferred from Irvine Valley College to UCI, I wasn\u2019t really sure of what I wanted to do. I was leaning, mostly, toward medical school. But, as I took more classes, I realized I really enjoyed physics and chemistry classes, which led me to think that if I went to medical school I wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on these topics.\nI decided to come into UCI as a mechanical engineer major and transferred into that field. Then, I had another change of plans and ended up majoring in biomedical engineering. This way, I could also satisfy the part of me who wanted to be a doctor.\n**How did I hear about the SOROS fellowship?**\nWhen I was at UCI, I worked in a couple of labs doing research. I remember talking to professor Chang Liu and Elliot Hui about applying to graduate school and they recommended that I apply to fellowships and talk to other graduate students about options. I learned about the NSF and I also learned about the SOROS fellowship through them.\n**Did you visit the SOP office?**\nI did, when I wanted examples of NSF essays.\n**Tell us about the SOROS. How did you write a competitive application and sell your case?**\nThe **SOROS** is a unique fellowship. I would say that they are looking for funding people as opposed to funding ideas. The NSF funds you based on an idea, mostly.\nWhen it comes to the **SOROS** fellowship, you have to be an immigrant or the son or daughter of an immigrant.\nHowever, what they really look for is more than an immigration story. They want you to show that you are a person who holds great potential to contribute to the United States as an immigrant. They also want to learn about the certain ways in which the United States helped you. In short, in the telling of this story, they want to know that the help an immigrant student received in the United States was life-changing and would not have been possible anywhere else. They also want to attract students who have a clear path to becoming future leaders in their fields.\n[Mohamad\u2019s Article Featured in the CalTech Website ](http://www.caltech.edu/news/abedi-receives-fellowship-new-americans-46522)\n**What is your immigrant story? Where is your family from?**\nIt\u2019s complicated. My family and I are Palestinian refugees.I came to the U.S. as a teenager. I was 17. In the beginning, I stayed with my aunt. A bit later, my sister joined, who is younger than me. As we got more financially stable, another family member would join. My family followed me later. As a virtue of being a refugee, we lived in Lebanon and we applied to come to the US. It was a very long process and toward the end, we got accepted to emigrate here.\n**How did you craft your story? The SOROS looks for students who value the US Constitution and demonstrate potential for creativity and leadership. What did you tell them that you wanted to do with your life?**\nOne major factor in my case as a refugee was that in other countries, I always felt I was a second-class citizen or even lower. In these countries, we didn\u2019t get a lot of opportunities. This was totally different when I came to the U.S. Here, I was treated as a U.S citizen, even though I wasn\u2019t one at that point.\nI was given a lot of opportunities here to be creative and to focus on school. One of the most important benefits was that the US allowed me to be involved in research, which is an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t have received anywhere else. The incredible opportunities I was given in the U.S. have been a major part of my story, and have influenced the path I pursued, and continue to follow today.\nMohamad and lab partners at Caltech enjoying a day off.\n**How did the SOROS connect with the NSF project and what did you do for the NSF?**\nBetween applying to the SOROS and the NSF there was a year. When I applied for NSF I was still at UCI. The project that I proposed then was inspired by the research I had done as an undergraduate student. But when I started graduate school I started pursuing a different project.\nThe one that I proposed for the **SOROS** fellowship was mainly focused on engineering cells in the brain, a project that was linked to the brain initiative launched by President Obama.\n**Tell me about the brain initiative that President Obama proposed.**\nA couple of years ago, the President directed funding of a billion or more (it is roughly half a billion per year and it has been going since 2013) to research the human brain. President Obama launched this initiative referencing that we understand the galaxies around us better than we do our brains. The White House wanted to pave the way towards understanding the brain by driving research towards developing new tools to study the human brain.\n**What graduate school are you attending?**\nI am pursuing a PhD in Bio-Engineering at Caltech. I didn\u2019t go too far. I like it here. I\u2019m in the middle of my 3rd year.\n**What are you working on right now?**\nRecently, I published a paper that details my work and what I\u2019ll work on in the future.\nI\u2019m working on developing proteins that respond to temperature changes. We are creating medicinal proteins intended to heal the body. Currently, people use light to communicate with brain cells, specifically, with neurons. The problem is that to get the light into your brain you have to drill a hole in your skull. The alternative is that you can use ultrasound to focus on a specific region of the brain and heat it without damaging the brain cells. But you also need a receiver that you can install in your cells so that they can respond to heat signals and that is where my work comes in. Through the use of an ultrasound, you don\u2019t have to drill and the light reaches within the brain.\n**What advice would give a student considering the SOROS and the NSF?**\nIf you are in a STEM field, participate in research. In my case, I ended up liking it so much that I changed my career to be a researcher, which was not my initial goal. Through the process of research, you start learning to be independent; you learn how to solve problems.\nThen, if you decide that research is what you want to do, fellowships become important because you can otherwise be limited to work on projects that a professor is working on, especially when the funding is coming from that professor.\nOn the other hand, if you have a fellowship, like the **NSF** or the **SOROS** , you have more freedom of choice regarding which school, which lab and which project you want to work with. It gives you a lot of freedom to do what you care about, which is the biggest plus you get out of these scholarships. This is the case for the **NSF**.\nWhat is unique about the **SOROS** is that they really care about people, which is not very common for other fellowships. When you become a **SOROS** fellow, they fly you every year, for 2 years, to New York where you get to meet with other fellows and discuss major issues with them. You meet people from a lot of different fields. I got to meet musicians, people that work in the business field, people who work in clinical medicine, and many others. It is a great opportunity to meet all these different people who come from all these different fields.\n[Mohamad Abadi and Soros Cohort](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/161023-Soros-Conf-B-054.jpg)\nMohamad Abadi and Soros Cohort\nAll of us have something in common. We all came to this country as immigrants, and we are all more or less on the path to help advance the field that we are in in this country, which is something really nice and I don\u2019t think could be possible through any of the other fellowship.\n**How many years have you been flying to New York to meet with the SOROS team?**\nI\u2019ve been a SOROS fellow for 3 years, and they pay for your expenses to go to New York and stay there for a weekend. It\u2019s usually a combination of fun activities, skill-development, and networking. The aspect of making connections is very nice.\nThe year before, the U.S. Surgeon General, who is also a **SOROS** , sat with us and we got to discuss health issues affecting Americans. These are incredible opportunities to meet people that you would otherwise not have the opportunity to meet. These conversations allow you to meet amazing people on a personal level, interact, and build connections.\nThey book us all in one hotel; they plan every day and they have a schedule, including food, workshops, and talks.\n[Mohamad Abedi Soros Conference 2015](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/161021-Soros-Conf-C-057.jpg)\nMohamad Abedi Soros Conference 2015\n**How big is the group?**\nThe way it works is that every year they invite the class that won the fellowship that year and the year before so that\u2019s why I went last year and the year before. Next year, I won\u2019t get a paid invitation. I will have to pay for it myself, but every 10 years or so they have a big conference where everybody is invited.\nIMG_0512\n[Paul & Daisy 2015 class in the New York Times!](http://150429_nytimes_printable)\n**How does the SOROS conference appeal to the distinct fields? What do you have in common besides being immigrants?**\nWhat we all share in common is that regardless of your discipline, SOROS recipients are ambitious, self-driven people who are goal-oriented. They have tall plans and are working to achieve them. These traits, we all share in common, and we appreciate them in others, regardless of the field.\nThese are more than networking opportunities. You actually become friends. So if they are close to you, you can meet with them regularly in LA, for example, and whenever I fly somewhere, if I know there is a SOROS fellow, I email them or Facebook chat, \u201cI\u2019m around. Do you want to meet up?\u201d\nThere is a very strong networking component to the **SOROS**.\n[Mohamad Abedi-Soros cohort meets for conference ](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/12747452_814572371981738_6005100465540251764_o.jpg)\nMohamad Abedi-Soros cohort meets for conference\n**What countries or world regions are represented in your class?**\nA big variety: Middle East, Iran, Egypt, in my case, United Arab Emirates, Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, China, Taiwan, India, South America.\n**What did you have to do to apply for the SOROS?**\nYou write 2 essay. One, of your work and your plans for the future, and the other, is about your American experience, your immigration story and why U.S. values are important to you and how you have used those values and opportunities to charge ahead.\nOnce you send this in, if you are selected, you attend a personal interview, either in New York or LA. They fly you there, and you are interviewed by previous Soros fellows and other people.\nWhen I interviewed, the panel had previous **SOROS** winners and the Mayor of L.A. was one of the people who interviewed me. From the 70 candidates, they pick 30 to win the fellowship.\n**What was the interview like? What questions did they ask?**\nYou go through 2 interviews. Each interviewing committee has 4 or 5 interviewers. Questions include: which research are you working on; what do you do in your free time; what\u2019s important to you, other than work.\nThey are looking for certain type of people. They really want to find out who you are as a whole.\nThey tailor questions based on your background, and they are really interested in understanding your goals and they ask you lots of personal questions.\n**Do you remember those?**\nYes. They asked, \u201cyou told us about your research, you are busy all the time, but do you have something else in your life or do you only do research?\u201d This is the point where they look to see if you are a well-rounded person and that question surprised me.\nI told them, I do spend most of my time in lab because for me the lab is fun. It never feels like an obligation. Some people find fun in sports or movies which I do participate in. But for me, working in the lab and interacting with my colleagues is fun, and what I do for fun.\n**What sense did you get from the interview process? What are they looking for?**\nThey really want people who are showing strong potential in whatever field they are in. They don\u2019t really care about specific types of research. What they care about is that you are a person who in the future will make the fellowship\u2019s name and reputation more prestigious. The more successful you become, the more prestigious the SOROS becomes. They look for the people who have the potential to become successful, to become leaders in whatever they are doing.\nIt\u2019s not enough to have an immigrant story. It\u2019s important to show how that story affected you and informed the person that you are today. And if that person shows promise, then that\u2019s the person they want to keep as a SOROS fellow.\n**How has the SOROS process changed you?**\nI think the biggest advantage, other than the money, is the amazing people I would have never had the chance to meet in my life. These meetings give you new perspectives. They inspire you because they show you what other people are doing with this opportunity and their personal drive. We help each other out to reach these goals. We encourage each other to stay motivated, to stay inspired and to stay connected.\n**What would you tell a student who is preparing to apply for the SOROS. What should they definitely cover in their essays?**\nShow that being in the U.S. has helped you become the person that you are. Connect your story to how these opportunties have developed a patriotic spirit for the U.S., that you are on the path to success because of the U.S. and in turn, your success will help the U.S become a better country.\nThe **SOROS** is a patriotic fellowship that is interested in making this country better.\nThey want to see people who have the potential to be successful so in the application and interview it is important to focus on the bigger picture and demonstrate that what you are working on could be useful and impactful for the country as a whole.\nShow them that you have a clear path of where you want to be in the future. They don\u2019t want people who are unsure. They want people who have a goal, are driven and know what they need to do to reach that goal.\n**How did you convince them that you are going to be successful? What are the values of America that you love and that push you to be the best that you can be? How will you give back and be a contributive member of U.S. society?**\nThe first question relates to the American dream. It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are. If you put in the effort and the work, opportunities will be open to you and you will be able to reach what you want.\nIn other countries, in order to be successful, you have to come from a big family name, or you have to be rich. Over here, when I came to the U.S. my name didn\u2019t mean anything and I wasn\u2019t financially in a good place, but because I was putting in the work and I had a vision, doors opened for me, either through fellowships, scholarships, or assistance. Doors will be open to you to reach your goal as long as you put in the work for it.\nThe second part, how I convinced them that my project will be impactful, it is very important to have strong letters of recommendation. I can talk all day about who I am and what I plan to do, but it is through the letters verifying that, that the committee can start to see it. When professors write letters making comments like, \u201cI know this person; I\u2019ve seen his work; I know that he will be x y z in the future,\u201d this is really important.\nAnd in my case something else that helped me during graduation from Irvine, was that president Obama during his commencement speech, one of the people he mentioned was my name, Mohammad Abedi came as a refugee and now he is working on his Ph.D. getting an endorsement from the president, saying I got here as a refugee and now he\u2019s going to do great things, helped me a lot in my application for the **SOROS.**\n**How did President Obama learn about you?**\nWhen the president decided he was coming he had people contact UCI for recommendations. He wanted to mention names. They asked people for profiles and biographies and sent them back to the White House and the White House contacted me a day before to verify information. They said there is no guarantee that he is going to talk about me. When I went to the graduation, I wasn\u2019t even sure. It was great when he mentioned my name.\n**Any other advice you\u2019d give students thinking about fellowships?**\nIt isn\u2019t only about the grades. Doing research is important, learning how to be a good writer is important. Also important is to seek help, ask for help. There are a lot of nice people who have a lot of information and are very willing to help, but you have to seek them out. Be active about the things that are important. When I wrote my application, I sent it to tons of people; whoever was willing to read my application. Many people write their applications and they are either shy or they don\u2019t want to share it. Get as much feedback as possible.\n**What is next for you? What do you want to do after you get your degree?**\nI\u2019m working on completing a Phd so I can start a career as a tenure-track professor. I would love to stay in California. I love the weather here.\nMohamad is available to answer questions about his journey, experiences and life accomplishments.

If interested, please visit[Events](http://scholars.uci.edu/events/) to sign-up._**\n**Overview**\nThe Knight-Hennessy Scholars program fully funds graduate education in any major at Stanford University. The program aims to make a substantial impact on global social issues by bringing together future leaders in government, business, and nonprofit careers to enact change through collaboration. While completing their graduate degrees, Knight-Hennessy Scholars will participate in the King Global Leadership Program and co-curricular activities at Denning House on the Stanford campus.\n**Eligibility**\nApplicants from every country of the world are eligible to apply within four years of graduation from their undergraduate institution. You must apply separately and be admitted to your graduate program at Stanford through the standard selection process prior to receiving a Knight-Hennessy scholarship.\nBegin the process during the spring before your final year on campus by submitting a [Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/). Current seniors or recent UCI alumni may also apply. You must finish your bachelor\u2019s degree before enrollment. However, you do NOT need to have earned a bachelor\u2019s degree by the time you apply.\nCandidates should have **outstanding** records in academics, leadership, and community service, as well as sustained and energetic participation in other activities, such as athletics or artistic pursuits. Recent recipients have had exceptional academic achievement and demonstrate strong preparation for the proposed course of study at Stanford. The scholarship itself does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, applicants should have at least a 3.7 GPA, and for many Stanford graduate programs, a 3.9+ GPA and significantly above-average test scores (such as GRE, MCAT, LSAT or GMAT) will also be necessary to achieve admissions. Applicants must also be able to demonstrate professional competence and dedication to the field of study through leadership or founding roles in academic or service organizations, entrepreneurial ventures, publications or performances, and/or significant work experience/internships related to the major.\nPlease note that external scholarship agencies will consider all of your credit-bearing coursework from any college or institution as part of the review process (including CSU, community colleges, private colleges or other UC campuses/Extension programs, and including units earned while in high school). Grades from other colleges will be included in calculation of your overall GPA for eligibility purposes.\nBecause both the Stanford admissions application and the Knight-Hennessy Scholars application require distinctive letters of recommendation, competitive candidates must also have sufficiently strong relationships with at least three academic mentors (instructors or research supervisors) and at least two mentors who can attest to the applicant\u2019s strengths in service activities and leadership potential, in their letters of recommendation.\nWe should note as well that Stanford\u2019s doctoral programs typically fully fund at least three years for their students, regardless of whether you receive the Knight-Hennessy scholarship. Students who are applying for Ph.D. programs at Stanford and want to become Knight-Hennessy Scholars should demonstrate excellence in research, as well as be able to demonstrate the capacity for positive social change in the practical sense, beyond knowledge-building contributions that have indirect social impacts.\nUCI graduate students: contact the [Graduate Resource Center](https://www.grad.uci.edu/services/grc/index.php) for advising.\n**Degrees Funded**\nKnight-Hennessy funds Scholars across all of Stanford\u2019s [seven graduate schools](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/stanford-experience/stanford-schools), including M.A., M.S., M.B.A., M.P.P, M.F.A., and other master\u2019s level degrees and also J.D., M.D., Ph.D., and other doctoral degrees (as well as joint degree combinations). See the full list of available [graduate degrees](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/graduatedegrees/).\n**Selection Procedure**\nWorking with SOP advisors is optional, but encouraged. Campus endorsement is also optional. To begin the SOP advising process, juniors, graduating seniors, and alumni within 1 year of graduation complete a [Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/). In April and May, SOP staff review Pre-Applications and meet with potential applicants to discuss their candidacy and subsequent steps. For detailed information about each stage of the application process \u2014 including the roles of campus endorsement and evaluation \u2014 please view the **[Application Process Overview](http://wp.due.uci.edu/sop/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2019/04/2019-20-GUIDE-Application-Process-Overview-Knight-Hennessy-Final.pdf)**.\nAfter completing the Pre-App and meeting with SOP staff to discuss your candidacy, you will work on multiple drafts of the Knight-Hennessy Scholars application as well as prepare your graduate admissions application. Your supporting documents, including two non-academic letters of recommendation, will be due this summer. If you would like to earn campus endorsement of your Knight-Hennessy Scholars application, you will also be required to participate in an endorsement interview in August where the campus committee will determine whether to nominate you.\nThe electronic application includes an application form, test scores, 2 letters of recommendation, a resume targeting the Knight-Hennessy selection criteria, two essays, and a brief video response to a creative prompt. You will also need to apply separately to your department at Stanford University.\nAfter both Stanford graduate programs and the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program review application materials, shortlisted candidates are invited to interview and participate in group activities at \u201cImmersion Weekend,\u201d held on the Stanford campus in Winter Quarter (late January or early February).\n**Recent Recipients**\nAcross many majors and diverse cultural backgrounds, Knight-Hennessy seeks to find students with the potential to succeed in highly visible leadership roles and demonstrated capacity to create positive change. The official selection criteria are \u201c1) independence of thought, 2) purposeful leadership, 3) civic mindset.\u201d\nThe [Scholar biographies](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program/scholars) posted online can help in understanding how these broad criteria apply to specific academic disciplines and are enacted concretely in leadership achievements and career trajectories. UCI does not yet have a Knight-Hennessy Scholar.\n51 Knight-Hennessy Scholars were funded in the first cohort (2018), and the class size will gradually increase to 100 in future years, with about one-third of the awards going to students from the United States.\n**Finances**  \nKnight-Hennessy scholarships include three years of graduate funding, optional research or social entrepreneurship funding, and a stipend for on-campus housing, health insurance, books and supplies, travel to/from Stanford, and other basic living expenses.\n**Comments**\n\u201c**Philip H. Knight** , MBA \u201962, provided the founding gift to the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program. He was excited by the opportunity to partner with Stanford to launch a transformative program and wished to honor John Hennessy\u2019s 16-year tenure as president of Stanford University. Co-founder and Chairman  _emeritus_ of Nike, Inc., Knight wrote his business plan for Nike while a graduate student at Stanford. He has since been actively engaged at the university and a generous contributor to its programs.\u201d\nKnight-Hennessy is a fantastic, if highly competitive, opportunity for students whose ambitious career goals are a good fit with Stanford\u2019s graduate majors and who seek to actively collaborate with an interdisciplinary, international cohort of scholars to work on major global problems.\n**For More Information**  \nPlease consult [the Knight-Hennessy website](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/).\n**Access the[Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/scholarships/big-10-pre-application-information/) between late February \u2013 early April annually to begin the application process.**\n**SOP is able to advise competitive undergraduate candidates at UC Irvine only.**\n## Related Posts\n[Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\n##  [Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\nJan 5, 2022\nUCI (Big 7 Pre-Application) Mandatory Advising Deadline: November 14, 2019 at 12:00 noon Pacific Time for Fall 2020...\n[The Harry S.

He completed two UROP projects (2012\u20132014) under the guidance of James Steintrager. The subject of the former project (H.P. Lovecraft) was the topic of his UTeach classes (2013\u20132014). After graduating, Kenneth moved to Finland as a Fulbright student at the University of Helsinki to complete his M.A. in Religious Studies and is currently working on a teaching degree in the subjects of English, Latin, and Religion for Finnish public education. In the future, Kenneth hopes to pursue a PhD exploring the missionary practices of Manichaeism, an ancient religion that was practiced from the Roman Empire in the west to Tang China in the east and which now, because of the religion\u2019s wide geographical spread, demands the equal cooperation of western and eastern scholars.\n**Tell me a little bit about your UCI experience. You were awarded a Fulbright and were a finalist for the Marshall. How did you connect with these opportunities?**\nI started as an English major and later wanted to learn Greek, so I learned Ancient Greek. My professors told me I was a good classicist, so I ended up double-majoring in English and Classics and graduated Magna Cum Laude. It was really cool because, in my year, we had Obama.\n**I understand you joined the Campuswide Honors Program and through them, you learned about the Fulbright and SOP.**\nYes. I got to know about the CHP in my freshman year, and they exposed me to a lot of scholarship opportunities.\nYou learn a lot from CHP because the advisors are great and they fill you in on everything. I had Mary Gillis. She has this great memory and really personalizes the process, and I think all the advisors there do that as well. You just learn a lot by being in that environment. Students can be more scholarly-oriented in the honors\u2019 program, and that\u2019s what I have always enjoyed. I have always found it nice to connect with students who appreciate the same.\nThere are a lot of perks of being in the CHP. In general, it makes you very curious about things.\nI think I may have learned about the Fulbright then. They definitely encouraged me to visit SOP.\n**What was your experience with SOP? Did you come into the office to get feedback for your Fulbright and Marshall applications?**\nI came in all the time. I was probably an annoying visitor. I went through the applications; I studied them and received good advice from Michelle Tsai.\nCHP told me to go to SOP, so I made an appointment and started the application process. I remember it took me a long time.\n**Tell me about your Fulbright experience.**\nI was drawn to the Fulbright because I had heard so much about it and I wanted an opportunity to do a Masters somewhere. One of the many Fulbright opportunities is that they allow you to use a Masters Program as a Fulbright project.\n****\n****\n[Kenneth Fulbright Presentation](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/Fulbright-Presentation.jpg)Kenneth Fulbright Presentation\n****\n**How did you narrow down what you would do for your Masters Program?**\nI wanted to broaden my experience to see if English or Classics, my two undergraduate majors, were the right options for me or another field that I was interested in. I looked for a field that would harmonize the abilities and language skills I developed in either discipline and found the perfect match in Religious Studies.\nThe Fulbright website lists many options you can pursue, and since I was interested in Finland, I looked into it and found out that there is a strong partnership between the Fulbright program and the University of Helsinki.\nIn fact, I learned later that Fulbright in Finland was one of the first Fulbright programs to launch, and they have been winning a lot of awards because they have created lots of different Fulbright opportunities, not just for students, but also for teachers in mid-careers who want to gain expertise in a different subject.\n**Once in Finland, who advised you academically?**\nIt was actually Antti Marjanen. He\u2019s been my main research advisor in Finland and my research project was in partnership with him. Initially, I looked into the Nag Hammadi Library, an Egyptian collection of early-Christian manuscripts discovered in 1945. I\u2019ve since been interested in Manichaeism, an ancient Iranian religion with several key discoveries dating back to the 1890\u2019s up until most recently the 1980\u2019s, with some discoveries in Egypt.\n[Master's program after thesis symposium \\(advisor sitting in middle of couch\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/Masters-program-after-thesis-symposium-advisor-sitting-in-middle-of-couch.jpg) Master\u2019s program after thesis symposium (advisor sitting in middle of couch)\nThere is quite an active archeological society in Finland, and I\u2019ve been really interested in following the different groups they have here: the Nordic Coptic Network and the Finish Egyptological Society, among others. There are a lot of research networks in Europe and lots of opportunities available for doing archeological studies as well as primary research.\nMy research is not archaeological in nature but many of my colleagues are archaeologists in background and at least some archaeology is always needed in ancient history research\n**Tell me about your experience in Finland. Were you well-prepared for it? Was there something that surprised you? What was a day in your life like?**\nI would say that I was rather prepared for the research part. But, I was completely unprepared for the living part because, as a native Californian, I had never experienced a proper winter before, so I was shocked to see snow.\nRegarding adapting to the country, the Fulbright program in Finland prepared me well for the whole living process. They had a one-week seminar where they took us through how to set up a bank account, how to use the libraries in different locations, and how to contact different people. We were even introduced to some basic Finnish, which wasn\u2019t entirely necessary because most Finnish people speak English and especially, in academia, their English is quite good.\nI was unprepared regarding how to look for research material. In Finland, there is a long bureaucratic process before you can access research sources.\nThis was the biggest challenge for most of us, trying to contact the right people who had access to the materials we needed to look at. For example, at the national library it took us a couple of months to get access to some papyri that we needed.\nIn another case, a library had moved and lost some manuscripts, which was very unfortunate. The confusing part is that they don\u2019t notify you online that they no longer have those manuscripts. That was the biggest challenge, knowing where your primary sources are. But I think this applies more to the humanities and social sciences than other fields.\n**Where did you live? Were there others with you? Was this more of a solitary journey?**\nNone of it was really solitary. They have a buddy system. So, Fulbright alumni who are living in Finland partner up with incoming Fulbrighters and guide you through the whole process. In my case, I had 2 Fulbright buddies. One of them picked me up from the airport, and the other one had the responsibility of showing me around Helsinki. The Fulbright office had even arranged for an apartment to be set up for me, and it was very close to the university so I pretty much didn\u2019t have to worry about anything when I got there. They had everything set up.\n**How would you describe your relationship with your mentor. Was it enjoyable? Did you learn a lot?**\nI would describe the process as a bit slow. I\u2019m glad that my Fulbright period was a bit longer, (I\u2019m completing a Masters), than the regular 10-month research stay. It is very difficult to develop a relationship with an advisor when you have a short time. Nordic people have a reputation for being a bit slow in terms of getting to know someone. In my case, it took me about a year before I got to know my advisor, but once that happened, it\u2019s been a really fruitful relationship.\nNow, we regularly read Coptic together. We participate in a reading group at the university, and we also read Greek, Latin, and Arabic together. He has even invited me to his cottage, where he even smoked the salmon himself, which was amazing. After the period of a year, I can say that I feel we\u2019ve become good friends and good research partners.\n**How long will you stay in Finland?**\nI\u2019m still there. I\u2019m thinking about staying in Finland and doing a PhD. I\u2019m currently living with my Finnish girlfriend who is now visiting California with me. She actually studies in the same university with me.\n[Me and Helmi \\(girlfriend\\) at an academic party ](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/Me-and-Helmi-girlfriend-at-an-academic-party-sitsit.jpg) Me and Helmi (girlfriend) at an academic party\n**How did you craft your Fulbright application? How did you sell your case and what strategies did you use to get yours awarded?**\nThe process was very long and arduous. There are lots of things you have to do and lots of recommendations. I went through many drafts including different motivation essays and research proposals.\nI got to know my recommenders well. My undergraduate thesis advisor, James Steintrager, was a big role model for me. He was actually a Fulbright scholar himself**.**\n**As a student, how do you know what professor has completed a Fulbright? How do you find out?**\nI just happened to ask, and it turned out that my professor was one. In fact, many professors do complete Fulbright programs. Through word of mouth, if you ask your advisor in your department, they probably know who\u2019s done a Fulbright.\n**How did you describe your project and what you wanted to do?**\nI described it as looking through primary sources that had been studied by my advisor and seeking to develop an American and Nordic collaborative effort. I think that\u2019s the thing they are interested in: how you can connect different countries and, in my case, there was already an active Nordic community across national borders, interested in my topic.\n**How did your research contribute to a cultural exchange?**\nIt helps when your research has an element of cultural ambassadorship. I included that in my project because I believe that\u2019s the way that research should be done. Especially when it\u2019s a very closed field like mine, 4th-century, Egyptian literature. The topic is not something that lots of people study, so it helps to have a mindset that you are working alongside different partners in your area.\n**Why does is Finnish government invested in this topic? Why is Finland interested in Egyptian literature?**\nThe Finnish government cares about this topic because they have a Coptic collection in Finland, including papyri and parchment that remain unpublished. My advisor and other colleagues have been working on related Coptic material in early Christianity since the 80s. It\u2019s something that has boosted Finland into an international reputation.\nThe Finnish government has been investing in this and similar projects since the 80s.The reason? I think that Europeans tend to have a different mentality from Americans. They don\u2019t think, _what is the benefit of this?_ They sort of think, _what can we learn? Is there something to be learned?_\nThat\u2019s the litmus test they use when it comes to research in Finland, _is the research valuable to those who are interested in it?_\n**What skills are required to work with papyri and other related primary sources?**\nWe are looking into unpublished papyri and there is a lot of interest in it because anyone in the field can learn from this finding. In order to study it, you need the material to be published. Yet, before you can study it you need to have very good language skills to unpack the content in the sources. For this reason, the project has always received investment and funding.\n[Fulbright seminar \\(upon arriving in Finland\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/Fulbright-seminar-upon-arriving-in-Finland.jpg) Fulbright seminar (upon arriving in Finland)\n**How many languages do you speak that are related to your research with primary works?**\nManichaean texts are studied in a number of languages. I am able to read Ancient Greek, Latin, middle Iranian/Persian languages, Arabic, Hebrew, Coptic, and classical Chinese and have a fair grasp of French, German, and Italian. Many of these languages, I\u2019ve been learning in the past years and during the Fulbright period. You have to know the ancient languages fairly well in order to understand the ancient primary sources.\n**How do you find the time to learn so many languages? What\u2019s your process?**\nYou surround yourself with people who are interested in the languages and you read literature with them. The nature of the texts is that they are written in such a way that reflect the way that in the ancient world there wasn\u2019t this idea of one person speaking this one language, but rather, people spoke many different languages. One text might be in three different languages and they might be studied in three different languages. So you may have French commentary, a German commentary, and an English commentary. You sit down with a Hebrew text, Arabic text, and a Coptic text and you read the English, French, and German commentaries together and then in my case, you might have someone discuss it in Finnish, so you many have several different languages going on at the same time when you read one text. Once you get into this groove, you start picking up the language. You might also start studying some of the languages. I picked up Arabic and Hebrew. Once you learn one, the language family becomes a bit easier to grasp.\nMuch of it is self-taught. In my case, the Master\u2019s program exposed me to some courses where I could learn some of these languages. The focus of my Master\u2019s program is on the comparative study of emergent (Rabbinic) Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. There were thus teachers in Coptic, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Akkadian, several ancient languages so I had those classes available and I had reading groups at the university as well as my own independent learning.\n**How does this connect to the application for the Marshall?**\nFor the Marshall, I was using my English Literature background. For that application, I focused on Early Republic history. Specifically, American and British literature. So I was focusing on reading about early nationalism in the Early Republic of America. I was thinking of transatlantic studies, reading British and American literature comparatively, and trying to see what kinds of economic theories could emerge by reading these sources side by side.\n**What were you hoping to do?**\nThe Marshall allows you choose from 2 Master\u2019s programs that are each, one year long, or 1 Master\u2019s program that is two years long. I was interested in the first option because my thinking was that I could expand my research knowledge in the field of English literature. So I was hoping to begin to do more theory-oriented research related to Britain and America at Warrick, then move to the University of Oxford from where I could look more closely at British literature in the early 19th century.\n**Did you apply to both at the same time?**\nYes.\n**You were awarded the Fulbright and were a Finalist for the Marshall.** **What tips would you give students who want to pursue a Marshall?**\nThe Marshall was another post-war creation. Read their website and learn about the beginnings of the Marshall scholarship and the special relationship between the US and the UK. Understanding the history of this relationship is critical to consider when applying. In fact, they ask you to describe what the special relationship is in one of their essays.\nSome of my friends have gotten the Marshall through different universities and what I\u2019ve noticed they are interested in is the relationship between America and the UK. _What are you adding to the special relationship?_ _How does your research probe and challenge the special relationship?_ In my case, I didn\u2019t especially develop my research topic to suit this, but I was working on my undergrad thesis trying to find a way to relate it to the question.\nI found this research field in transatlantic literature, exchange, and proto-nationalism and was hoping to connect my findings to the modern relation between British and American writings and the British and American political system. This is something that they are very interested in.\nThe Marshall, although better funded than the Fulbright, would have required that I move to 2 different cities within one year. It is designed for people committed to British-American related fields.\nI wanted more of an international experience. In the ancient world, things were very messy. There wasn\u2019t one location or one language.\nThe Fulbright worked out much better for the type of work I wanted to do. I was able to get that international feeling just being among different scholars and learning a language that wasn\u2019t English. Being exposed to different languages is something I really value. I would have gone for the Fulbright had both opportunities manifested at the same time.\nWith the Marshall, they want you to stay in the UK.\n**What advice would you give students who are contemplating a Masters through a Fulbright?**\n**Master\u2019s program:** Look for opportunities that interest you. I was drawn to the pan-Nordic emphasis of this Master\u2019s program, which include universities in Norwary, Sweden, Denmark and Finland and you travel to each university for 1 week for a contact seminar. I was interested in meeting different professors, developing a relationship with them and exploring if their research was compatible with mine so I could pursue a Ph.D with them afterward.\n**Doing research:** look at what\u2019s unique about the country. Regarding Finland, not many people know that there is this papyri in Finland; you wouldn\u2019t think to look here, but there is a lot to be published in Finland. Look for unique sources or unique circumstances. Some of my colleagues want to come here specifically to study the Arctic or to do Cardiac Research in the Finnish population because they are a rather close society; they have a rather uniform gene pool. Something like this gives a uniqueness to your research approach.\nGenerally, whether you are going for a Masters or a research-oriented project, the biggest thing is thinking of being a cultural ambassador. _What are you adding to the local research community and the community in general?_\nI noticed that all the Fulbrighters when they got there, were interested in Finnish culture. We all had some language background or were interested in learning it while we were there. We were interested in the culture, technology, anything that was Finnish. We generally had an idea of what we were interested in.\nThat\u2019s the biggest thing. You have to be interested in the country and the culture.\n[Master's Thesis Presentation about Manichaens](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/Masters-Thesis-Presentation-about-Manichaens.jpg) Master\u2019s Thesis Presentation about Manichaens\n**Why is it important to focus on connections?**\nIt comes from this idea that the Fulbright comes from a post-war setting. So, there is something that is nationalistic about it. The people who work at the Fulbright center do want to see something that relates America and their respective country. It might be a bit of an old argument but it does still apply.\nI think it\u2019s still about prestige and about uniting researchers in different countries with each other. If you think about how after the war, countries were so divided, through the Fulbright process, you can rebuild relationships. We are more advanced now, but the idea of understanding, and collaboration is still something they want to work on.\n**For you, what came first, the region or the topic?**\nI think they came at the same time. I was already interested in a couple of topics and in religious studies, in particular. When I found my advisor, I explored my advisor\u2019s interests to see if they would be a good fit.\n**You mentioned earlier that the Fulbright experience is about a relationship, about collaborating. What have you brought to Finland as a contribution?**\nAt this point, I\u2019ve taken up a teaching degree in Finland. I\u2019m studying to be a teacher in English, Latin and Religious Studies for secondary school. I want to contribute as someone who specializes in these fields, as someone who has done some research here and teach high school students within a realm of relatively good expertise.\nAlso, learning Finnish is another contribution. I would like to contribute to different publications in the language by collaborating with Finnish researchers. More specifically, I would like to publish in American journals alongside Finnish collaborators.\nI\u2019m still working on these contributions. They are not fully accomplished yet, but I\u2019ll continually work on them.\n**If I were to ask you, how has the Fulbright process changed you? Have you grown as a result of this experience in Finand?**\nYes. I\u2019ve become a better researcher; I\u2019ve become more aware of international relations, and I\u2019ve become aware of Europe in general. I\u2019ve come to value my time at UCI more than I had expected. I think this is because while being in Finland, I\u2019ve become aware of the different institutional settings and how universities work in America versus in Europe and the role of politics in these settings. The EU was rather elusory to me while I was in America, even though I had worked in German and French and had even received a scholarship from the European Studies Department at UCI. Being here you learn so much about every country. You see the U.S. in a different light, not only in light of the recent election, but reading about your own country while being abroad is also a learning experience. You see first hand, how the outside world processes your country\u2019s politics.\n[Traveling with some friends to a cottage](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/01/Traveling-with-some-friends-to-a-cottage.jpg) Traveling with some friends to a cottage\n**Do you feel like being abroad made you more patriotic and brought you closer to America or distanced you?**\nI think I\u2019ve become more of both. I\u2019m more well-informed and in general, it\u2019s made me a better American. I can better compare the history of America vs. other countries and I\u2019ve had many opportunities to talk about this. I\u2019ve met many Europeans who are interested in learning about how Americans think of their own country in light of recent events.\nEspecially as an Asian-American, it is shocking for Europeans to think of Americans as not being white, male and fat. I get that all the time. Most people think I\u2019m Chinese. They start talking to me in an Asian language that they\u2019ve learned. I tell them, _I\u2019m American, actually_. I do speak Mandarin, though. It\u2019s an educational process for Europeans as well. Thanks to the program, they get to meet many different types of Americans.\n**What is next for you?**\nIn the end I would say, research. I find research to be very rewarding. It is hard work, sometimes solitary work and you can also meet a lot of people. In the end, we share the research with people so it\u2019s never completely solitary. It\u2019s as solitary as you want to make it, I would say. Some people work alone and it\u2019s detrimental to their social life. But, if you take it upon yourself to connect with others then it becomes a very cooperative, rewarding work. This applies to whether you are working as a researcher or a teacher. I see myself teaching in Finland, and I would be satisfied either way, working in research or as a teacher. After all, in Finland, a teacher is a researcher. You have to have a Masters degree to teach in Finland.\n**Do you have any final words of encouragement for prospective candidates?**\nMany students seem too daunted by the prestige and the long application process of big scholarships that they disqualify themselves before applying. Just go for it. The road is long, but the journey is well worth the trials. Listen closely to your advisors and, most importantly, stay curious.\n_I want to say that I\u2019m really grateful for SOP. They gave me a lot of confidence through the preparation process and the interview drills. They gave me so much information about what I had to do.

    "content": "# Fulbright U.S. Student English Teaching Assistantship\n### Placement Types\nPlacements are available in approximately 83 host countries in multiple world regions: East Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, South and Central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Western Hemisphere (i.e., South and Central America). \nThe age and academic level of the students varies by country, ranging from kindergarten to university level. Applicants for ETA Programs can apply to only one country. Consult the table on the [English Teaching Assistant Program description](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/types-of-awards/english-teaching-assistant-awards) for details on specific country requirements and numbers of awards.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Fulbright U.S. Student Program places no limitations on your major or field of study. However, some countries give preference to majors in the Humanities, Education, or related fields, or to those who have completed TESL or TEFL certifications.\nYou must possess the interpersonal skills, ambassadorial mindset, and teaching, tutoring, or mentoring competencies to be a strong classroom teacher. English Teaching Assistantships require [three ETA employment reference forms](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/instructions-for-eta-recommendation-writers) from individuals who can confirm your abilities to teach, tutor, and/or mentor youth in the English language.\n### Eligibility\nTo apply for the Fulbright U.S. Student Program through the SOP advising process, applicants must:\n  * Be undergraduate juniors (graduating next academic year), graduating seniors (graduating this academic year), or recent alumni within 12 months of graduation.\n  * Be citizens or nationals of the United States of America at the time of application. Permanent residents are not eligible. \n  * Complete your undergraduate degree before travel (often, but not always, by the end of Summer Session I). Consult the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries) for the program start date.\n  * Meet the language requirements of the award to which you are applying, demonstrated by submitting a Foreign Language Evaluation. Consult the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries) for the language proficiency requirements.\n  * Demonstrate sufficient competency to complete your project and adjust to life in the host country.\n\n\nFor most programs, applicants who have had extensive, recent previous foreign experience in the host country are at a competitive disadvantage but are still eligible to apply. In some cases it may not be feasible for a dual national to participate in a Fulbright program in the country of his or her other nationality due to host country law or policy. However, enrollment in a formal study abroad program as an undergraduate will not be considered a disadvantage. Please see [Eligibility](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/eligibility), including the Ineligibility section, for details.\nThose who have lived or worked abroad (i.e., outside of formal study abroad programs) are encouraged to apply to a host country where they have not yet lived. Since Fulbright is an international exchange program, you are encouraged to apply to a country where you would not yet be considered \u201ca cultural insider.\u201d \nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that English Teaching Assistant applicants achieve at least a 3.5 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of experience related to the selected grant type and proposed project. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of leadership, teaching, tutoring or mentoring roles in academic, extracurricular, or service organizations; education-related research experience or publications; and/or education-related work experience/internships.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nTotal value of the award varies by country. Grant benefits for all Fulbright U.S. Student grants include:\n  * round-trip transportation to the host country\n  * funding to cover room, board, and incidental costs, based on the cost of living in the host country\n  * Accident & Sickness Health Benefits\n  * 24/7 support line for urgent and non-urgent situations\n  * 12 months of non-competitive eligibility (NCE) hiring status within the federal government\n\n\nIn some countries, grants may also include:\n  * book and research allowances*\n  * mid-term enrichment activities\n  * full or partial tuition\n  * language study programs\n  * pre-departure and in-country orientations\n\n\nSpecific information concerning finances for each country is described in the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/regions) and/or posted on the local Fulbright Commission website.\n### Recent Recipients, Finalists, & Semi-Finalists\nAs of 2020, UCI has had 68 undergraduate and recent alumni Fulbright U.S. Student Program grant recipients. Read about recent recipients and semi-finalists on our [Recipients](http://scholars.uci.edu/scholarship-recipients/) page.\n  * In 2022, Audrey Garcia, Elizabeth Montoya, Irene Morales, and Uyen Mai were Englisht Teaching Assistantship Recipients. Daniel Rojas, Joshua Swank, and Catthi Ly were named Semi-Finalists. Janice Zhong and Vian Nguyen were named Alternates.\n  * In 2021, Katia Necoechea Madriz and Victoria Thiem were named Finalists. Irene Morales, Ravi Sandhu, Emily Ha, and Rosemary Velasquez were named Semi-Finalists.  \n\n  * In 2020, Shih Yuan \u201cMita\u201d Huang (History, Education Sciences) was named a Finalist (grant offered but declined due to Covid-19) for the English Teaching Assistantship to Mongolia.\n  * In 2019, [Madeleine Hart](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/2020/04/06/madeleine-hart-fulbright-germany/) (Psychology) became an English Teaching Assistant in Germany, and [Joyce Nguy](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/?s=joyce&search=) (Political Science, Education Sciences) became an English Teaching Assistant in Taiwan.\n  * In 2018, [Leanne Lupone](https://leannelupone.weebly.com/fulbright.html) (Chemistry with CalTeach credential) became an English Teaching Assistant in Uruguay, and Priya Sri-Tharan was named a Semi-Finalist for the English Teaching Assistantship in Sri Lanka.\n  * In 2017, [Daniela Estrada](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/2018/07/05/daniela-estrada-fulbright-winner-colombia/) (Political Science) became an English Teaching Assistant in Colombia, Amy He (Education Sciences, Sociology) became an English Teaching Assistant in Taiwan, and [Tala Pirouzian](http://education.uci.edu/soe_news/spotlight_pirouzian_2016) (English) was named a Semi-Finalist for Turkey (Turkey grants were again cancelled due to political unrest).\n  * In 2016, Tala Pirouzian (English) was named an English Teaching Assistant Finalist for Turkey (Turkey grants were cancelled due to political unrest).\n\n\nFulbrights are prestigious, career-enhancing awards. They also confer special status on winners during their year of foreign study, as outstanding, officially recognized representatives of their country. Famous Fulbright recipients include Thomas Pickering, John Lithgow, and Renee Fleming. At least 47 UCI faculty have also received Fulbright grants.\n### Competitiveness\nApproximately 1,250 English Teaching Assistants are placed annually. Competitiveness varies significantly from host country to host country. Your odds of placement as an English Teaching Assistant can be improved by applying to countries with [comparatively low ratios of applicants to slots](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/statistics).\n## Related Posts\n##  [Fulbright U.S. Student Binational Business Internship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/fulbright-u-s-student-binational-business-internship/)\nMay 25, 2022\nPlacement Type Grantees will be placed in cooperating businesses and will also take courses related to international...\n[Carnegie Endowment Junior Fellows Research Internship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/carnegie-endowment-junior-fellows-research-internship/)\n##  [Carnegie Endowment Junior Fellows Research Internship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/carnegie-endowment-junior-fellows-research-internship/)\nMay 25, 2022\nPlacement Types James C.

    "content": "# Nathan Gamarra\u2013Tips from an NSF Winner\n#### \n[Nathan Gamarra](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/Nathan.jpg)\n_Nathan Gamarra graduated from UCI magna cum laude in 2013 with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. At UCI he worked in the training lab of Dr. Luis Mota-Bravo identifying patterns of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from local oceans and worked towards developing new assays to rapidly detect antibiotics in environmental samples. In the summer of 2011, Nathan did research at Stanford University as part of the Amgen Scholars program. There he studied the biochemical mechanisms of RNA enzymes in the Herschlag lab. After returning to UCI, he joined Dr. Sheryl Tsai\u2019s lab where he studied the molecular mechanisms of fungal enzymes that synthesize important antibiotics and toxins. Nathan is continuing his interest in enzyme mechanism in graduate school, where he is studying the mechanics of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes at UC San Francisco. As an undergraduate, Nathan presented posters at several research conferences winning awards at the AAAS conference in 2011 and 2012. In addition to an NSF graduate research fellowship, he was also the recipient of the Dean\u2019s Award for Excellence in Research and the Laurence Mehlman Memorial Scholarship._\nBelow, we caught up with Nathan to learn about his studies after UCI. He shared invaluable tips on good choices he made early on that helped him become a very competitive candidate for the NSF.\n**_How did you learn about the NSF?_**\nTwo ways: I went to an SOP information session on different scholarships.\nI was also involved in a [Minority Science Program (MSP) ](http://port.bio.uci.edu/)through the School of Biological Sciences at UCI. They are fantastic. This program supports students doing undergraduate research, and through them, I learned more about the NSF.\n[MSP Program at UCI ](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/MSP-Program-at-UCI-Facebook-Page.jpg)\n**_What role did the Minority Science Program play in applying to the NSF?_**\nDr. Marlene de la Cruz is the Associate Director, and Dr. Luis Mota-Bravo, is the Director of Outreach. They are the two people who run the program there, and they are funded by the National Institute of Health.\n[MSP Students-UCI](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/MSP-Program-at-UCI.jpg)\nTheir job is to get people from underrepresented backgrounds into Ph.D programs. So, the program is really geared towards getting people to that goal, and I credit them for all they\u2019ve done to get me there.\n**_When did you first hear about them?_**\nThey had sent me an email in my freshman year telling me that I should look into the MSP. I knew UCI was a research-focused university, so I was interested in finding out more and I went to one of their meetings. They told us about research and all the different possibilities that we could pursue. At the time, I was really interested in doing research as an undergraduate, so they set me up with a training lab, and that\u2019s where I learned basic techniques, protocols and things like that.\nFrom there, I worked in other research labs and expanded my experiences. Later, I applied for graduate school.\n**_How many of your peers ended up taking advantage of the NSF or applying for it?_**\nVery few, unfortunately. Many people are intimidated about applying to the NSF in their senior year. The problem is that the application is due at the end of October, right before graduate school applications are due in December. It is also a very competitive fellowship.\nLots of people who would have been very qualified for the NSF, did not apply because they were focused on classes and bunch of other things, but I felt like the application was very similar to a graduate school application, and I knew that I would be applying to graduate school so I essentially decided I was going to do it and it turned out that it worked, and it helped a lot in terms of getting to the schools that I got into.\n**_When you started at UCI did you know that this is what you wanted to do?_**\nNo. I knew coming into UCI that I wanted to do something science-related, and I liked biology and chemistry as well. I was deciding between doing something medically-related and something more research-based.\nI really liked the courses I was taking and I was interested in the academic aspect of things. Starting with the MSP research program led me down a path that ultimately worked out really well for me.\n**_What are the steps involved in applying for the NSF?_**\nYou have your basic application, which includes, letters of rec, transcripts and you also have to write 2 statements. One is a personal one, and the other is a research proposal. The personal statement should address your background, how you got interested in doing science and research, and ultimately, it should touch on your career aspirations and what you\u2019ve done to get there.\nThe other component is the research proposal. When you are applying as an undergraduate, it can be an intimidating process, but one that is worth it. You have to come up with a project proposal, explain how you would do it, address the results you expect to get, and if you don\u2019t get what you expect, explain what you would do then. This second part is important to address.\nIt\u2019s important to do as best as you can, but the people who are reviewing your research proposal, they understand that undergraduates don\u2019t have that much experience. They are looking to see if you are actually thinking about what you are doing. The most important thing about your research at this point is that you can communicate what you intend to do. Looking back over it now, my research proposal is definitely not the ideal proposal.\n**_Better to Apply to the NSF as an Undergraduate than as a Graduate Student_**\nI think it is very important to apply as an undergraduate for the NSF fellowship if you are serious about going to graduate school. Having funding early makes your life significantly easier in graduate school since you don\u2019t have to worry about applying for fellowships when you start your program. Applying early also helps your chances as many people don\u2019t apply as an undergraduate. Even if you don\u2019t get the fellowship, it is good practice for applying for the fellowship in graduate school and, since the NSF application is very similar to the graduate school application, it will make that application process a lot easier. Also if you don\u2019t get the fellowship, there is a good chance of getting an honorable mention which will significantly improve your chances of getting the fellowship when you apply as a graduate student. This is really important since you have a limited amount of times you can apply as a grad student.\n**_What graduate program did you decide on?_**\nI am a Ph.D. student at UC San Francisco. Here, the first thing you do as a graduate student is apply for the NSF fellowship. This can be a very stressful process while you are taking classes and working in the lab. For me, having the funding made my transition to graduate school much easier.\nIf you have any interest in applying for graduate school, you should apply right away. Also, there is a limited number of times you can apply. I think if you apply during your undergraduate program, then you get a second opportunity once you get into a graduate program. All around, I think it\u2019s a really good move for any student going into graduate school in the sciences to apply for the NSF.\n**_Did you look for a mentor or coach to guide the research aspect of your proposal?_**\nYes, the 2 people in the minority science program coached me. I was working in an undergraduate research lab, (by the way, anyone applying should have worked in, at least, one research lab), and the professor I worked under there, she helped me formulate the research, which was based on my undergraduate project.\n**_What advice would you give a freshman contemplating the sciences and wanting to become a competitive NSF candidate? What do you wish you had known when you first started at UCI and what advice do you have to offer?_**\n**Do research early and often and through as many opportunities as you can.**\nThe number one thing that got me the fellowship and got me into graduate school was research experience. That\u2019s one of the great things about UCI, is that it is so welcoming to students who want to do undergraduate research.\nI think the biggest barrier as a freshman is intimidation, not knowing things, worrying about not fitting into a lab culture, but you find as soon as you start doing it, that people know and understand where you are. Most people, considering how diverse UCI is, have probably been in your shoes, and so they know that you will find a good lab and good mentors by just seeking them out; there are so many opportunities at UCI, that\u2019s the best thing.\nThe specific research area does not matter that much. The most important thing is experiencing the lab culture and developing your network of people and research. Through that, you can start finding out if science is what you want to do.\n**_How did you get involved with your first research project? Where did you look for opportunities?_**\nI was super lucky. The MSP was really helpful in terms of helping me through that first barrier, which is getting a lab. The way that they do it is that they have their own training lab where they teach you to do very basic things and get you comfortable, and then after that, you can ask the professor to work in their lab and that\u2019s what I ended up doing.\n**_In addition to the MSP is there another program on campus that can help students prepare for research?_**\nIn addition to MSP, there is also, [**Camp at UCI**](http://www.cfep.uci.edu/camp/), which is the California Alliance for Minority Participation. The three-week CAMP Summer Science Academy (CSSA) is a residential program that prepares incoming freshmen for the transition from high school to UCI. To learn more about this program click [here](http://www.cfep.uci.edu/camp/programs.html).\n****\n[CAMP-California Alliance for Minority Participation](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/CAMP-California-Alliance-for-Minority-Participation.jpg)\nCAMP is based out of engineering school and they support students across science disciplines. They also help you find people who can help you get into a research lab.\n**_Advice to Freshmen going into the Sciences_**\nI would suggest for the first quarter focus on your classes and on doing well.\nThe first quarter is a hard transition, but after a quarter or two, once you are comfortable with the academics, just find whatever way you can to get involved with research.\nGo to these programs, which were, for me, super helpful. Work with the SOP program. Even if you don\u2019t participate in MSP or CAMP, when you take classes that interest you, talk to professors and ask them if you can work with them. Most professors will be more than happy to help and have you in their lab. Or if they can\u2019t, they may know of other labs that can hook you up with.\nOther students found research tips by going online and googling a particular professor.\nI didn\u2019t participate in UROP, but lots of my friends did, and it is another great resource.\n**_The Number One thing is Research-Use the Summers to Get Involved_**\nAnother thing I credit with my success is my summer research project in the biological sciences. Pretty much every university has an undergraduate research program that you can apply to, and they will pay for you to come out and do research in their lab for the summer.\nIt\u2019s a really great experience to do research that is normally outside of what you do and most importantly, **it is a great opportunity to get a letter of recommendation** **from someone outside of your university** , which I think was a huge deal for me.\n**I did my undergraduate research program at Stanford for a summer.**\nIt was a great experience. But, like the stress associated with applying to the NSF, some people stress out about applying to summer research programs, but if you get a chance to participate, you will learn invaluable training and you will build a network.\nIn my case, my Stanford experience got me a letter of recommendation from a professor at Stanford.\nProspective graduate programs definitely noticed. Whenever I interviewed for a graduate school, they asked about my time at Stanford and there were several people knew the professor and commented on the letter he wrote for me. The told me, good job! So it\u2019s a huge plus to do that as well.\n**_How competitive are summer research opportunities?_**\nThey can be competitive, but most summer research programs are really interested in supporting people who may not come from perfect backgrounds. They are really committed to increasing diversity and bringing underrepresented students into research and graduate programs.\nI encourage everyone to apply.\n**The other great thing is that those summer research applications are really simple, one or two letters of recommendation and a short personal statement**.\n**_Do you pay out of pocket to fly?_**\nThe program I applied to paid for everything. The vast majority of programs do. If you apply to the bigger schools most will cover that. In short, this is a huge plus to your CV and applications.\n**_What would you say to a student worried about maintaining a good GPA, and juggling lab, and research work? How to do all the extras and stay a strong student?_**\nI mean, it\u2019s super tough. It won\u2019t be easy the first year.\n**As far as prioritizing, grades should come first.**\nI think you want to get things done in research but if you don\u2019t have the grades, research will not matter. It is important, but you need the best grades you can get to get access to good things. Good grades will open more opportunities than maybe extra hours doing a small amount of research.\n**I would say grades first, but research is also very important.**\nDuring the quarters when I took really tough classes, I would come in at least 3 hours less per week because I knew I needed to work on my assignments. Most mentors will understand that your number one priority is classes at that point.\n**If you can get a project done and publish that would be amazing.**\nI didn\u2019t do that but I know several people did and that counted for so much for them. However, if your priority is to get into graduate school and fellowships, having the best grades possible is the most important first step.\n**_How did you decide on San Francisco?_**\nIt was a tough choice. I applied to many different schools and got into all of them. All the places that I applied to were equally strong in my research field, which made it very difficult to decide. I\u2019d say a very big part in my decision was the location. San Francisco is a cool place to live. I think a big part of your decision should include considering where you see yourself enjoying your life. Having a place that you enjoy living is irreplaceable. It\u2019s the whole experience. Equally important is the atmosphere of the graduate program and how well they support their students. UCSF is an incredibly collaborative and supportive place to work. You get a good feel for this when you interview at different Schools. Graduate school takes a long time to complete, so if you are going to spend 5 years living somewhere, it might as well be a place that you like.\nIf you would like to contact Nathan for any information on his experiences, please email him at: Nathan.gamarra@ucsf.edu\n## Related Posts\n##  [Alexander Alvara \u2013 Fulbright Recipient](https://scholars.uci.edu/2020/02/13/alexander-alvara-fulbright-recipient/)\nFeb 13, 2020\nAlexander Alvara (Fulbright 2017) Alexander is a recent alumni who triple-majored in Mechanical, Aerospace, and...\n##  [Brittany Schick -George Mitchell Scholarship Winner](https://scholars.uci.edu/2017/06/07/brittany-schick-george-mitchell-scholarship-winner/)\nJun 7, 2017\nBrittany graduated from UCI in 2005 having double majored in Political Science and International Studies with a...\n##  [Mohamad Abedi\u2013NSF Winner and SOROS Fellow](https://scholars.uci.edu/2017/01/16/mohamad-abedi-nsf-winner-and-soros-fellow/)\nJan 16, 2017\nMohamad Abedi-Dinner with the Soros Fellows and President Barack Obama Mohamad was born to Palestinian refugees in the...\n",

His research includes development of a carbon fiber unmanned drone, a user-controlled prosthetic hand, a mobile phone compatible spectrometer, and an \u201cexosuit\u201d for shoulder and bicep rehabilitation. Alexander was a mentor for the Office of Access and Inclusion and is now a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley in Mechanical Engineering researching condensed matter physics, high-energy nanotechnologies, and space systems. Alexander is also a recipient of the National GEM Consortium Ph.D. Fellowship, NSF CRFP Honorable Mention, and the Berkeley Chancellors Fellowship. In 2017, Alexander received a Fulbright U.S. Student Program award to research medical robotics and develop pediatric surgical robots for bone biopsy and neurosurgery applications at the University of Toronto in collaboration with The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and Engineering Services Inc., a precision robotics company.\n# Undergrad Wins Fulbright Award, SOP Encourages Student Scholarship Applications\n_May 25, 2017_ \u2013 Samueli School undergraduate Alexander Nicholas Alvara has won a Fulbright U.S. Student Program award, which provides funding for research outside of the United States. Alvara, a triple major who is completing his degree in mechanical, aerospace and materials science engineering this year, will work next year at the University of Toronto. He then plans to attend graduate school to pursue a doctorate.\nRecipients of Fulbright awards are selected on the basis of academic and professional achievement as well as record of service and leadership potential in their respective fields.\nIn Toronto, Alvara will collaborate with [Professor Emeritus Andrew Goldenberg](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/mie/faculty/goldenberg), a key figure in the field of robotics whose research encompasses mobile and industrial robots and robotic arms for a variety of industries, including space, nuclear plants, laboratory automation and image-guided surgery, as well as personal robots.\nIn his work with Goldenberg, Alvara will strive to develop better hardware and software to improve robots\u2019 abilities to grasp and handle objects they cannot \u201csee\u201d for surgical applications.\n\u201cI was in disbelief,\u201d says Alvara of learning that he had won the award. \u201cI tried to make sure it wasn\u2019t April Fools\u2019 Day still, and then afterwards, fact-checked the email address and contact info. When the realization set in, I was pretty shocked.\u201d\nHe describes himself as \u201cjust a transfer student from a poor and rough neighborhood,\u201d and says everyone can be successful with the right approach. \u201cAnyone can do what I did, especially those who have come from a place of hardship and those who seem like underdogs. \u2026You will always lose \u2026 if you don\u2019t try or [if you] don\u2019t apply, so apply to them all and do your best,\u201d he says.\nAlvara is grateful for the help of his adviser, Sharnnia Artis, assistant dean for access and inclusion. \u201cI want to make sure you know how much you have contributed to this and that I could not have done it without your guidance, time and dedication to each step of the process,\u201d he wrote in an email to Artis. \u201cYou have made this a possibility for me.\u201d\n\u201cThroughout Alexander\u2019s time at UCI, I have witnessed scholarship as being one of his utmost important criteria,\u201d Artis says. \u201cIn addition to being a triple major, he has research experience at UCI, Cornell, UCLA and University of Arizona, and is a peer mentor who serves as a great resource for students in and outside of the classroom.\n\u201cWith Alexander\u2019s research experience ranging from biomedical devices to robotics and nanostructures, this will be a great opportunity for him to expand internationally,\u201d Artis adds.\nThe Fulbright Program, which aims to increase mutual understanding between the United States and other countries, counts a host of distinguished alumni, including those who have become heads of state, judges, ambassadors, Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, MacArthur Fellows and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.\nTwo other Samueli School students recently received honorable mentions in prestigious scholarship competitions. Jordan Edmunds, an electrical engineering and biological sciences major, received honorable mention for the Barry M. Goldwater scholarship, while chemical engineering undergraduate Shiaki Minami got honorable mention for the National Science Foundation scholarship. The UCI Office of Scholarship Opportunities, which advises candidates applying for 15 competitive national or international merit scholarships including the Fulbright, Goldwater and NSF scholarships, encourages students to apply.

Truman Scholarship\n### **UCI (Big 7 Pre-Application) Mandatory Advising Deadline****:**\n#### **October 29, 2019 at 12:00 noon Pacific Time for Fall 2020 funding**\n**Access the[Truman Pre-Application](https://scout.eee.uci.edu/s/19-20Truman) between September and October annually to begin the mandatory advising process.  \n**\n#### **Overview**\nA $30,000 scholarship for graduate study in public service fields. The Truman Foundation defines public service as \u201cemployment in government at any level, uniformed services, public-interest organizations, nongovernmental research and/or educational organizations, public and private schools, and public service-oriented nonprofit organizations.\u201d Established by Congress, the Harry S. Truman Foundation\u2019s grants are for students who intend careers in government or public service and includes a service requirement. Additionally, the Foundation provides assistance with career counseling, internship placement, graduate school admissions, and professional development.\n#### **Eligibility**\nYou must be a junior pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree on a full-time basis and intending to graduate between December and August of next academic year; perform academically in the upper fourth of your class; be a U.S. citizen or a U.S. national; have selected a major that will permit admission to a graduate program leading to a career in government or public service at the federal, state, or municipal level; and have demonstrated an interest in such a career.\nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that applicants achieve at least a 3.7 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of noteworthy accomplishment, professional competence, and dedication to ambitious career goals in public service and governance, nonprofit leadership, or education. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of leadership or founding roles in extracurricular or service organizations; publications or performances; and/or significant work experience/internships relevant to the stated career goals.\nPlease note that external scholarship agencies will consider all of your credit-bearing coursework from any college or institution as part of the review process (including CSU, community colleges, private colleges or other UC campuses/Extension programs, and including units earned while in high school). Grades from other colleges will be included in calculation of your overall GPA for eligibility purposes. UCI can nominate 3 additional transfer students, defined as those who spent the first 2 years at a community or junior college. Transfer students with extensive public service or governmental participation are encouraged to apply.\n#### **SOP Advising Process**\nTo begin the SOP advising process, in late October, juniors pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree on a full-time basis will complete a [Truman Scholarship Pre-Application,](https://scout.eee.uci.edu/s/19-20Truman) due October 29 at noon.\nIn early November, SOP staff review Pre-Applications, determine whether you are eligible for the scholarship(s) you have chosen, and meet with potential applicants to discuss their candidacy and subsequent steps. Eligible candidates will receive an invitation to join our Big 7 Canvas Course, where you will find prompts, deadlines, and detailed instructions for how to prepare the following application first-draft materials:\n  1. An online application form (a sample of which can be found [here](https://www.truman.gov/sample-application-materials/));\n  2. A 500-word policy proposal to address a significant issue or problem in your intended area of public service;\n  3. Transcripts for all coursework for which you have received college credit;\n  4. Three (3) letters of recommendation: You will select one recommender to write about each of the following scholarship selection criteria: \n     * Leadership Abilities & Potential;\n     * Commitment to a Career in Public Service;\n     * Intellect and Prospects for Continuing Academic Success (composed by a faculty member).\n\n\nWhen choosing recommenders, be ready to inform them of [the category for which they will write](https://www.truman.gov/guidance-letters-recommendation/) (Leadership Abilities and Potential, Commitment to a Career in Public Service, or Intellect and Prospects for Continuing Academic Success).\n**Recommenders should provide signed letters on letterhead directly to SOP** by email at sklrship@uci.edu, campus mail (Zot code 5695), or drop them off in person at our office (193 Science Library, in the Writing Center). Please remind them to include their signatures on their letters. Letters will be due on **November 26, 2019** for consideration in the campus endorsement (nomination) process.\nIn early January, SOP will convene a faculty screening panel to nominate up to four (4) candidates and, additionally, up to three (3) junior transfer candidates. Nominees will receive detailed feedback for revision of their materials in January and work closely with staff advisors to prepare a final revision for submission to Truman.\n#### **Selection Procedures**\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Truman Foundation, applicants selected for interview \u201cshow a long history of involvement in what the program seeks to reward (public service and government activities), have exerted leadership, have fine academic achievements, reveal some unique and interesting (preferably memorable) aspects about themselves and their experiences, provide a graduate school proposal that makes sense, prepare a carefully thought out and well-researched public policy analysis,\u201d write well, and have strong letters of reference. The Director\u2019s detailed description of the qualities that distinguish successful applications and interviews are available in the SOP office.\nSemifinalists are selected nationally from university nominations, and are interviewed by Regional Review Panels composed of scholars and public officials. Each Panel recommends two people per state, plus up to six candidates for Scholars-at-Large.\nIn 2019, the Foundation selected 62 Truman Scholars from among 840 applications forwarded by over 346 colleges and universities. Winners were chosen by 16 selection panels on the basis of leadership potential, intellectual ability, and the likelihood of \u201cmaking a difference.\u201d Each panel typically included a university president, a federal judge, a distinguished public servant, and a past Truman Scholarship winner.\nMany winners major in economics, political science, or history, and law or public policy are common fields of intended graduate study. However, students in a wide range of majors may be strong candidates because a wide variety of disciplines prepare students for careers in public service. Students majoring in such fields as chemistry, engineering, environmental studies, foreign languages, mathematics, and computer sciences (among others) are encouraged to apply.\n#### **Recent Recipients & Honorable Mentions**\n  * In 2015, Daniela Estrada (Political Science) received the scholarship, and Julian Bugarin (Political Science and History) was declared a finalist.\n  * In 2014, Sanaa Khan (International Studies) was declared a finalist.\n  * In 2012, Felipe Hernandez (Music Performance and Political Science) received a Truman Scholarship.\n  * In 2006, Mukul Kumar (History) received a Truman Scholarship.\n  * In 2005, Vanessa Zuabi (Political Science and International Studies) was declared a finalist.\n  * In 2004, Jacqueline Chattopadhyay (Economics and Political Science) received a Truman Scholarship.\n\n\n#### **Finances**\nUp to $30,000 for the senior year and graduate educational expenses, in furtherance of a career goal in public service.\n#### **Comments**\nAn outstanding and highly prestigious scholarship for students who intend a career in public service. As a condition of funding, Scholars are required to work in public service for three of the seven years following completion of a Foundation-funded graduate degree program.\nThe application includes an analysis of a public policy issue or problem in the form of a memo to the officeholder you feel could do the most to resolve the issue. It also includes a statement of interest in a career in government or public service that shows how your educational plans will prepare you for that career, and three letters of recommendation.\n#### **For More Information**\nFurther information is available at [the Truman website](http://www.truman.gov/). You must submit your Pre-Application to the Scholarship Opportunities Program to request a login for the Truman application.\nQuestions about the campus advising and endorsement (nomination) process may be directed to the Scholarship Opportunities Program at (949) 824-0189 or sklrship@uci.edu.

    "content": "# Donald A. Strauss Public Service Award\n### About\nThe creation of the Foundation\u2019s [Public Service Award](https://www.straussfoundation.org/) pays tribute to the vision, ideals, and leadership of Donald A. Strauss, and to his life-long commitment to public service and education. The Foundation promotes the value of public service in the education and preparation of our future leaders. In financing innovative student-generated projects which foster leadership skills, we encourage optimism and an enduring interest in public service.\nA central part of the application package is an **original proposal for a community or public service project** to be carried out between the end of the sophomore or junior year and the spring of the following year; these proposals are a major focus of the selection process.\nWhile the idea and implementation of the Strauss Public Service Project must originate with the student, partnership is allowed with organizations serving the public interest. These include national, international, regional, or local health organizations; environmental organizations; and non-profit organizations whose primary purpose is to help disadvantaged persons to access education and health care services, or to develop viable businesses.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Strauss Foundation places no limitations on the applicant\u2019s field of study or major.\nFields of study which can lead to public service and a Strauss project include (but are not limited to) the sciences, both biological and physical, engineering, agriculture, environmental management, economics, political science, and the other social sciences, English, history, and the other liberal arts and humanities, fine arts, public health, public administration, business, government, and education.\n### Eligibility\nDonald A. Strauss Scholarship applicants must be full-time enrolled undergraduate sophomores or juniors who have:\n  * Demonstrated interest in public service.\n  * Outstanding leadership potential.\n  * Developed effective communication skills that can be demonstrated\n  * The desire to \u201cmake a difference\u201d in local, regional, national, or international communities.\n  * One or two years of full-time undergraduate study remaining until graduation.\n  * A GPA in the upper 1/3 of his or her class.\n  * Submitted an innovative, original, public service project proposal, to be completed between May of the current year and April of next academic year.\n\n\nThere are no citizenship restrictions.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThe Strauss Foundation will award no fewer than ten and no more than fifteen $15,000 awards each year; these will be used to pay expenses of the public service project and for some tuition, fees, books, room and board.\n  * A minimum of $8,000 of this award should be used as a project grant to fund the student\u2019s service project expenses.\n  * Up to $7,000 of this award can be used as a scholarship to be applied to the student\u2019s educational support.\n  * The entire award of $15,000 may be used towards the project.\n\n\n### Recent Recipients & Alternates\nRecent UCI recipients have had a demonstrated record of public and community service on and off campus, including one or more leadership roles, as well as a strong and feasible project proposal. Their projects represent a diverse array of academic and community service interests and have had a positive impact on various groups, from youth to seniors. Their projects have been conducted locally, in other parts of the state of California, and even internationally. Recipients present the results of their projects to the Donald A. Strauss Foundation Board in the Spring of the following year.\n  * In 2023, Joshua Nguyen (Public Health) received the Strauss and Killam Scholarship.\n  * In 2021-22, Jira (Hugh) Trinetkamol received the Strauss Scholarship.\n  * In 2021, Steven Gong (Economics, Biological Sciences, and Political Science) received the Strauss Scholarship.\n  * In 2020, Karishma Muthukumar (Biological Sciences and Cognitive Sciences) received the Strauss Scholarship.\n  * In 2019, Woojin (Janet) Song received the Strauss Scholarship for \u201cPromoting Digital Equity in Oakland: Wash and Learn and Youth Participatory Action Research.\u201d\n  * In 2018, Anne-Marie Leiby was named an Alternate (waitlisted for funding) for \u201cLimitless Leaps, a Program Cultivating Community and Empowerment Through Dance.\u201d\n  * In 2017, Bhavesh Patel received the Strauss Scholarship for \u201cTowards a Healthy Future: A Youth-Based Community-Wide Tobacco Intervention in Rural India.\u201d\n  * In 2015, Anna Tran received the Strauss Scholarship for \u201cPay It Forward: Enhancing the Quality of Life of Seniors While Bringing Generations Together.\u201d\n  * In 2014, Christine Pham received the Strauss Scholarship for \u201cMy Healthy Start: An After-School Program for Elementary Students.\u201d\n\n\n### Competitiveness\n**As we typically have more applicants than nomination slots, achieving campus endorsement (nomination) for this award is extremely competitive.** Applicants apply through their universities. Each participating institution will select up to 3 finalist applications for submission to the Foundation. Applications will not be accepted directly from candidates.\nWith regard to selection criteria, the Strauss Foundation emphasizes that the public service project proposal should be:\n  * Clearly focused on social change, public service, and/or social entrepreneurship. \n    * Projects must engage other students or local participants in public service, to generate a \u201cmultiplier effect.\u201d\n    * It is not the intention of the Foundation to fund internship requirements, research, or the creation of a publication.\n  * Original, innovative, and timely. \n    * Include an idea, angle, or approach that has not been pursued widely and/or that addresses important current issues.\n    * If the project is an expansion of an existing program, there should be a clear demonstration of new features or major additional outreach or impact.\n  * Sustainable over time. \n    * The project should be sustained throughout the school year, not just one week or one summer.\n    * Applicants must include plans for recruiting and training future project leadership and provide a timeline for implementation.\n  * Connected to the applicant\u2019s passion(s) and life experience(s). \n    * It should be clear to reviewers that you are the right person to lead this project and ensure its success.\n\n\n## Related Posts\n[Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/paul-daisy-soros-fellowship-for-new-americans/)\n##  [Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/paul-daisy-soros-fellowship-for-new-americans/)\nMay 25, 2022\nAbout The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans is a $90,000 merit-based fellowship exclusively for...\n[Knight-Hennessy Scholarship at Stanford University](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/knight-hennessy-scholarship-at-stanford-university/)\n##  [Knight-Hennessy Scholarship at Stanford University](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/knight-hennessy-scholarship-at-stanford-university/)\nMay 25, 2022\nAbout The Knight-Hennessy Scholars program cultivates a diverse, multidisciplinary community of emerging leaders from...\n[Harry S.

    "content": "# Fulbright U.S. Student Binational Business Internship\n### Placement Type\nGrantees will be placed in cooperating businesses and will also take courses related to international business at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico (ITAM), one of the most prestigious private universities in that field in Mexico. The most significant component of the program is the internship; grantees will spend about 90% of their time working in the company.\nIn recent years, COMEXUS has placed grantees in a variety of organizations, including traditional and multinational companies, financial institutions, airlines and start-ups. Please note that the list of participating companies and NGOs is subject to change every year. COMEXUS is unable to guarantee placements in specific companies, sectors, and/or industries.\n### Fields of Study\nPreferred candidates should have less than three years of work experience post-graduation and major in one of the following fields: Business Administration, Finance, Economics, International Relations, Law/International Law, Accounting, or another business-related field. \nCandidates with a bachelor\u2019s degree in another field may be considered if they have demonstrated experience and interest in international business. \n### Eligibility\nTo apply for the Fulbright U.S. Student Program through the SOP advising process, applicants must:\n  * Be undergraduate juniors (graduating next academic year), graduating seniors (graduating this academic year), or recent alumni within 12 months of graduation.\n  * Be citizens or nationals of the United States of America at the time of application. U.S. Permanent residents are not eligible. U.S.-Mexico dual citizens are eligible to apply. Candidates who currently hold a temporary or permanent residency card to Mexico are not eligible to apply.\n  * Complete your undergraduate degree before travel. Consult the [Binational Internship summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedprogram/105) for the program start date.\n  * Demonstrate Advanced proficiency in Spanish. Spanish language proficiency is necessary, not only for the internship, but also in order to communicate at a university level. Applicants should include in the Language Self-Evaluation plans for language study between the time of application and the commencement of the grant. A Foreign Language Evaluation by a college-level Spanish language instructor is also required.\n  * Demonstrate sufficient competency to complete their project and adjust to life in Mexico.\n\n\nApplicants who have had extensive, recent previous foreign experience in Mexico are at a competitive disadvantage but are still eligible to apply. However, candidates residing, working, or studying in Mexico in the year prior to beginning the grant are not eligible. \nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that Binational Internship applicants achieve at least a 3.2 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of experience related to the selected grant type and proposed project. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of related work or internship experience; business-related research or publications; and/or leadership roles in entrepreneurial or startup ventures, or business-related campus or off-campus organizations.\nCandidates must be adaptable and proactive, able to take initiative in both professional and educational situations in order to thrive in a highly independent program. Rather than a traditional study abroad, the Binational Business program is designed for flexible, self-sufficient grantees able to seize the moment, establish and manage expectations, and forge valuable experiences throughout the program.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nGrant benefits for all Fulbright U.S. Student grants include:\n  * round-trip transportation to the host country\n  * funding to cover room, board, and incidental costs, based on the cost of living in the host country\n  * Accident & Sickness Health Benefits\n  * 24/7 support line for urgent and non-urgent situations\n  * 12 months of non-competitive eligibility (NCE) hiring status within the federal government\n\n\nApplicants should take into consideration that the Binational Internship grant covers maintenance and basic living expenses in Mexico, as well as one round-trip air ticket (U.S.-Mexico-U.S.). Grantees may incur additional expenses that are not covered by the grant. It is highly recommended that grantees begin the program with some additional savings to cover these expenses, especially because the first grant payment will arrive in late September.\n### Recent Recipients\n  * In 2021, Laura Estrada (Political Sciences) became a Semi-Finalist for the Binational Internship in Mexico.\n  * In 2010, [Jason Molina](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/2011/01/07/jason-molina-fulbright-mexico/) (International Studies, Economics) became a Binational Intern in Mexico.\n\n\n### Competitiveness\nFrom 2018 to 2020, the Binational Internship received between 55 and 79 applications for 16 internship placements. The competitiveness of this program is close to the overall average acceptance rate for a Fulbright U.S. Student Program grant in recent years (~2,000 recipients worldwide from a pool of ~10,000 applicants).\n## Related Posts\n##  [Fulbright U.S. Student English Teaching Assistantship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/fulbright-u-s-student-english-teaching-assistantship/)\nMay 25, 2022\nPlacement Types Placements are available in approximately 83 host countries in multiple world regions: East...\n[Carnegie Endowment Junior Fellows Research Internship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/carnegie-endowment-junior-fellows-research-internship/)\n##  [Carnegie Endowment Junior Fellows Research Internship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/carnegie-endowment-junior-fellows-research-internship/)\nMay 25, 2022\nPlacement Types James C.

    "content": "# Jacqueline Rodriguez-Fulbright ETA Semi-Finalist-Venezuela\n[Jacqueline and President Barack Obama ](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/Jacqueline-Shaking-Obamas-Hand.jpg)\n_Jacqueline Rodriguez is the daughter of Salvadoran working class immigrants. Both her parents fled El Salvador during the Civil War and settled in Los Angeles, California where Jacqueline was born. At age 5 Jacqueline\u2019s mother died of cancer and her dad, with the help of her grandmother, raised her. Today her father is a big-rig truck driver and her stepmother is a homemaker. It was her parent\u2019s immigrant narrative that shaped Jacqueline\u2019s perspective, academic interests, and career aspirations. She became the first in her family to graduate from college and is the product of public higher education. Jacqueline holds an associate\u2019s degree from Mount San Antonio Community College, a bachelor\u2019s degree from UC Irvine, and a master\u2019s degree in education policy from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign._\n_While at UC Irvine she was a student coordinator for the Early Academic Outreach Program where she mentored students in low-income high schools to help prepare them for college. She was also a research assistant for Dr. Maria Rendon\u2019s study on the mobility prospects of second-generation Latino males in Los Angeles, helping analyze neighborhood effects, family dynamics, peer ties, education, and social and financial support. She studied abroad in Greece and Cyprus and was involved in student-led organizations on campus. She ultimately received dual degrees in Sociology and Chicano/Latino Studies and went on to become commencement speaker alongside President Barack Obama in 2014._\n_Currently, she lives in Washington D.C. and is an associate consultant for Manhattan Strategy Group where she manages federal projects for the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (U.S. Department of Education) that support disconnected youth and adults in obtaining the necessary knowledge and skills for employment and economic advancement in a 21st century global economy. Jacqueline plans to continue pursuing a career in the workforce and economic development but is looking to ultimately do so internationally, for a Latin American government, ideally her parents\u2019 country of El Salvador. In doing so, she plans to eventually pursue a master\u2019s in public policy with a focus_ in _international development. While in graduate school she plans to apply for Fulbright once again to conduct research on job training and security measures for disconnected youth in El Salvador._\n**What was the journey leading up to your Fulbright Finalist ETA position?**\nI was an undergraduate at UCI, where I double-majored in Sociology and Chicano Studies. When I was applying for the Fulbright, I applied for the Venezuela program to teach English. At the moment, I was very interested in educational development in Latin America and international education policy and that led me to apply to the Fulbright, ETA. While I did not receive the Fulbright scholarship, I did become a semi-finalist so I\u2019m really quite familiar with the process. Through the application process, the SOP office was very helpful. Michelle was especially helpful.\n**What do you think are the ingredients of a successful application? You made it to semi-finalist status. What was the process like for you?**\nA lot of times when students apply for grants, they start to tailor their resumes and statements to fit the prompts. I think those steps are important, but if you start to notice that you are tailoring too much or struggling to put things together, I think that\u2019s a good indicator that your purpose or reasoning for applying may need some work.\nTo write a successful application, you have to have a very clear vision of why you want to do a particular work, whether it is research or the ETA.\n[Zot Zot Zot](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/Jacqueline-Showing-Obama-Zot.jpg)\n**For example, some of the questions you should ask yourself are:**\n_What is it about this particular country that calls you to teach English there or do a research project?_ The answer cannot be abstract in any way or general. I think what makes a really good statement is for you to have a really strong connection to that country. If you say, for example, \u201coh, I want to improve the educational development there for different socio-economic reasons in Latin America,\u201d that statement may not be enough because it could apply to many different Latin American countries. The better question to ask yourself is, _why would I want to contribute to, let\u2019s say, Argentina, specifically?_ What is your connection to that country? Have you been studying it? Does it connect to something else you\u2019ve been doing? Did you study abroad in the region? I think having that connection is really important. With that said, I think you should start the process way in advance before you apply.\n**What I hear you say, is that the Fulbright application for the ETA is not something you can do on the spot without preparation in other areas of our life. You have to have build other related experiences and expertise.**\nExactly, I think it\u2019s something that maybe you\u2019ve already been working on. It\u2019s more like, \u201cI would like to do this, in order to continue doing the work I started here,\u201d which is different than seeing an ETA as a personal opportunity to go travel.\n**That has to be tricky, especially when you are applying to teach English and so many students are applying to do the same. How do you make your case stronger than somebody else\u2019s?**\nYou could start building your case by connecting it to a course you took where you studied the issues. You could also connect it to a study abroad experience. For example, you studied abroad in Vietnam and became aware of water issues, and then took a course on it. I think that\u2019s already a good path for it. This could be used to show, \u201cI\u2019m already familiar with this.\u201d You can also network with organizations and highlight that connection.\n**And this is something that someone might not put together. You might think, I can teach English. But does the student think beyond and into the cultural collaboration and contribution component? What else does the student bring to the country?**\nExactly. It\u2019s not only being a U.S. ambassador but also how would you benefit that country by being able to provide English language abilities. It is definitely important to cultivate a certain type of relationship.\n**Jacqueline, why did you originally choose Venezuela?**\nI think I chose it because in some of my Latin American classes I had studied the economic challenges there, specifically in terms of their default. I had also studied educational policy there. These classes drew my interest in that country and so I built my case, stating I wanted more hands-on experience to understand and work in educational policy in the classroom and teach English at an elementary level.\n[jacqueline-obama-final-celebration](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/Jacqueline-Obama-Final-Celebration.jpg)\n**How in-depth did you study the locale and the student body? How did you craft your statement?**\nI think that\u2019s where I fell short. I didn\u2019t have enough time. By the time I started gaining more interest, I had not spent enough time to develop a deeper relationship. I think it would have been really good for me to reach out to organizations early on, study the work that they were doing in the classroom, and maintain that contact.\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s really hard to get specific on a locale, because you don\u2019t know where the Fulbright might place you. They might place you in a rural setting or they might place you in a capital city. It\u2019s a gamble.\nYou pick the country, and you say, _this is where I want to go and for these reasons_ , but you really can\u2019t say, \u201cI want to specifically do this type of work in the city,\u201d because if anything, you could jeopardize yourself by saying that in your application. You don\u2019t know where they are going to place you.\nIt\u2019s tricky in that you have to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the country and its issues but, at the same time, you want to make sure you are not focusing too much on a specific area or region within the country because you might be limiting yourself for other opportunities.\n**How important is it to have relatable experiences teaching in under-resourced areas?**\nThat\u2019s another important piece of advice that I received from other people. You want to be very strategic in explaining what skills you would use to thrive and carry out your work in a very challenging environment.\nYou could end up in a place where there are lack of resources or teachers that don\u2019t show up, or you may have a complete lack of understanding for an educational culture, so you have to be able to convincingly explain how you could, in a situation that might be very tough, still persevere and maintain your mission, focus and efforts. What related experiences can you pull from?\nI have a friend who did the Fulbright in Colombia. His application was really good because not only did he demonstrate the different types of international experiences he had with specific student-age groups, but he also demonstrated he had experiences working in under-resourced, low-income type of environments. He was able to provide teaching and instruction to students, under duress, and he also demonstrated he was resourceful. I think that\u2019s key to the Fulbright ETA. You have to be able to demonstrate that.\n**When you received the semi-finalist news, did they share why you were a semi-finalist and not a winner?**\nSo, there are 3 different reviews. The first one is from UCI, seeing if they want to endorse you and push your application forward. Once it\u2019s pushed forward, the U.S. reviews your application. That\u2019s another application pool. Then, the U.S. selects candidates depending on the country. I believe it was 20 applicants for Venezuela. Next, the U.S. sends those 20 applicant materials to Venezuela, and then Venezuela has the final decision, which also depends on how many spots they have available. In my case, there were only two. Finally, Venezuela then chooses from the 2. I was a semi-finalist.\nSo by the time you become a semi-finalist, the U.S. has approved you. This is why they say becoming a semi-finalist is a really big honor, because the U.S. has selected you.\nAfter Venezuela makes its final decision, you don\u2019t know why they selected the way they did.\n**Did you use all the time and work spent on crafting this application to apply for other things, like graduate school?**\nDefinitely. The Fulbright application process is extremely rigorous. It definitely helped me with other application processes, in terms of getting acquainted with how to craft my own personal statement, but specifically, the statement of work. I definitely applied to graduate school. I applied for an educational policy program and I completed a 2-year Masters program in Education Policy.\nCurrently, I\u2019m living in D.C. and work for a federal contractor overseeing different department of education initiatives. I\u2019m still really interested to taking these experiences to an international arena, specifically in Latin America. At some point, I might try to pursue the Fulbright but in a research capacity.\n**Are there any final tips you\u2019d like to share that can be useful to a student who wants to teach through the ETA Fulbright program?**\nBesides having a direct connection and showing how you can be resourceful under stressful circumstances, I think overall, having a passion and vision for being a Fulbrighter. What does Fulbright really mean to you? How are you going to exemplify that as a U.S. ambassador? Understanding the mission and believing in it is really important.\n**What was your source of inspiration for applying?**\nI took a class with a professor who knew my interest. He told me about it, and encouraged me to look into it given my international interest and my background.\n**Did you know who to ask for letters?**\nBy the time you are becoming a Fulbright or are in the running for it, you should know who to ask for a letter of recommendation. You\u2019ve been involved in work or doing research with certain professors.\n**In your opinion, how early should students learn about the Fulbright opportunities so that they have enough time to craft themselves as competitive candidates, rather than say, I haven\u2019t done enough to make me a strong candidate for these fellowships.**\nI\u2019m so glad you are bringing this up because this was kind of my struggle, especially coming out of a first generation background, working-class student. I was obviously not aware of any of these opportunities and for most of my college experience that\u2019s what it was like. It was me hearing it from professors, or me, _rebuscandole_ , searching for opportunities on my own.\nI think it would be really important for freshmen to access this information, and equally important, for those who disseminate it, to be mindful of their audience. Where are you advertising these fellowships? What classrooms, what groups? Are you preaching to the choir? It\u2019s beneficial for elite students to access this information. But what about the students who normally would not be exposed to knowledge of all these opportunities while they could be very well-deserving of them?\nImagine who they could become if they were to be empowered with information on how to become great candidates early on. They could start crafting their own profiles from the beginning to become really competitive Fulbright candidates.\nSometimes we don\u2019t have access to these opportunities until it\u2019s too late in the game. I, personally, always felt like I had to play catch-up as a first-gen student.\n**Where should Fulbright be promoted on campus to reach minority candidates?**\nGoing to student services and talking to transfers, first gen, foster students would be a great place to start. Exposing them to opportunities to build themselves is really important. I know one of the things I was always told in my application, although flattering, was, \u201cyour story is just so compelling, Jackie.\u201d And although I was flattered, I didn\u2019t just want to be the student with a compelling story. I wanted to be the student who was seen as someone who had also done all these other amazing things. Minority students are usually caught playing catch up, so they are not usually exposed to these other opportunities they can venture into it.\n**In retrospect, what advice do you have for first-gen students who want to apply for fellowships later on?**\nGet involved in as many things as possible that can help develop your interests. If some organization intrigues you, get involved and volunteer, participate in internships, go to talks, for example, professors always have panel talks. UCI has many community organizations and student cultural houses. I would try to tap into all of those and try to find out what else interests me. Little by little, try to get as well informed as possible. What are the different opportunities available? Ask professors and also, cold email professors.\nAs first generation students, I think there is a lot to say for having great mentors. I think mentors can really help first generation students successfully transition into higher education. First-gen students are really scared to approach mentors and professors and I think we should be more encouraged to do that. By this I mean, what to say, how to ask them for a meeting to talk about common interests and find out more about specific topics and fields. Many professors would be willing to meet with you. This helped me as well. Having the right people by my side and reaching out to the right mentors.\nI was able to find out about research opportunities by talking with professors and getting involved in student organizations. By sophomore year, you should be really intentional. Ask yourself, what is the profile and image I\u2019m creating for myself in an academic sense?\nI would tell them that crafting your image early on is super important. Ask yourself, who am I? What is my selling point? What are my interests?\n**What did you have to overcome? Why is your story compelling and why do you think you were chosen to become a commencement speaker when Obama was here?**\nFor the 2014 Graduation, I\u2019d say I fit into the immigrant narrative. My parents were Salvadoran refugees, and then coming from a working class family, I was a first-generation student who attended community college first and then transferred to UCI. Here, I got involved in the early academic outreach program, which provides college counseling to low-income high school students. I also became involved in different student organizations on campus, different scholars programs and I did research with professors. I then went on to pursue my graduate degree and got accepted to NYU and Columbia but due to tuition, I was not able to go there. I did attend the University of Illinois and they offered me a full ride, so I think it was not only my background but also the fact I was a child of the California public education system. I went to a community college, then to a UC institution. This is something that California wants to promote as the norm rather than the exception.\n_[f614a531-4c23-4d9b-9a02-df03eef753f8-3](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/F614A531-4C23-4D9B-9A02-DF03EEF753F8-3.jpg)_  \n_If you\u2019d like to contact Jacqueline to find out more, she can be reached at:[jacqueer@uci.edu](mailto:jacqueer@uci.edu) _\nTo view Jacqueline\u2019s commencement speech, please click on the video below:\n## Related Posts\n##  [Alexander Alvara \u2013 Fulbright Recipient](https://scholars.uci.edu/2020/02/13/alexander-alvara-fulbright-recipient/)\nFeb 13, 2020\nAlexander Alvara (Fulbright 2017) Alexander is a recent alumni who triple-majored in Mechanical, Aerospace, and...\n##  [Brittany Schick -George Mitchell Scholarship Winner](https://scholars.uci.edu/2017/06/07/brittany-schick-george-mitchell-scholarship-winner/)\nJun 7, 2017\nBrittany graduated from UCI in 2005 having double majored in Political Science and International Studies with a...\n##  [Mohamad Abedi\u2013NSF Winner and SOROS Fellow](https://scholars.uci.edu/2017/01/16/mohamad-abedi-nsf-winner-and-soros-fellow/)\nJan 16, 2017\nMohamad Abedi-Dinner with the Soros Fellows and President Barack Obama Mohamad was born to Palestinian refugees in the...\n",

    "content": "# Long-Co Nguyen: Strauss Recipient \u2013 2009 (Vietnam)\nLong-Co working with a student\nMy name is Long-Co Nguyen and I received the Strauss Scholarship in 2009. As a contributor to the SOP blog, I\u2019ll try to give insight on the process of applying for a scholarship and the experiences the scholarship has offered me. And hopefully, upon hearing about it from a fellow student, any intimidation you may feel will be alleviated (because trust me, if I can do it, you can), or inspire you to apply for a scholarship.\nThe first time I ever went to Vietnam was in 2005 with my family. I didn\u2019t know what I expected, but it was definitely not what I actually saw: people walking through sewer water every day when the tide came up, children dying of preventable diseases, dirty water, and not enough food. Since then I joined Me Oi and the Red Cross that operates in Long An. Later, I founded a non-profit organization, Medical Educational Missions & Outreach (M.E.M.O.), to provide healthcare (in the form of yearly medical missions and a program to treat children with congenital heart disease) and educational opportunities (by way of a scholarship program). Then, with the Strauss Scholarship, I was able to do something that I never thought I could: build a school.\nIn 2008, I flew back to Vietnam to pass out supplies and repair damages left by a flood in Long An. A few members from the Red Cross and I drove until all traces of urbanity disappeared and damaged huts became visible. Here, there are no more streets that cars can drive through; the rest of the way would have to be either on motorbike or by foot. There was only one motorbike available driven by a guy that looked like Jin from  _Lost_. Unfortunately, my mom had decided to accompany me on that particular trip, and jumped on the back of the motorbike and yelled to the Jin look-a-like, \u201c[\u0110](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90 \"\u0110\")i \u0111i! (Go now!).\u201d And so I was left with the \u201cby foot\u201d option. Now that I look back it was definitely a good thing. I got to do as Will Self, an acclaimed novelist, does and practice psychogeography in a way. And because of that I got to really learn about the people, and consequently, about their needs. One can be well-traveled, but know nothing about where they\u2019ve been. Before when I went somewhere I was in my head along with an imposed mindset about the place. What is needed for a true experience is to couple the mind with the physical world. In this 3 hour walk, I learned more about Vietnam and the people than I have in the last 3 years I\u2019ve visited there. I passsed villagers who were harvesting rice from wet paddies and girls washing dishes in the river. A family that we met on the way offered us coffee. As I sat there talking and drinking coffee with the villagers I learned two things: (1) if given the right influences and opportunities, their sons and daughters that dropped out of school because of monetary reasons to beg and steal on the streets, would instead start to dream about becoming mechanics, engineers, and doctors and (2) with this coffee, I am going to be awake until 2025. What needed to be done, then, was create those opportunities.\nAfterwards, I learned that Intel had opened a hi-tech electronic plant in District 9 of Ho Chi Minh City and that it would need about 4,000 new employees. Besides Intel, there are also many other electronic companies in Vietnam, like General Electric and IBM, that are either in business or about to open. So if a free trade school is built to offer training in electronics, people that are too poor to gain an education and a decent job can acquire the necessary skills for one of these jobs and raise their families out of poverty. Working alongside the Diocese of Qui Nhon and KonTum and Damin Hoang ,we managed to get the building built, obtain the permits, and find qualified teachers. The only thing we needed was equipment. SOP informed me of the Strauss Scholarship which awards $10,000 to implement a public service project. With SOP\u2019s help, I applied and won. Because of this scholarship, the Electronic Vocational School in Qui Nhon was able to officially open on September 9, 2009 with twenty students. And since then, all twenty students have been offered jobs in local manufacturing companies upon completion of their training. And now, interviews for the next class are being conducted and we plan to have 20-30 new students in March. With the Strauss Scholarship, the vocational school will not only make an impactful, sustainable change in these students\u2019 lives, but will also change the lives of many future students to come.\n## Related Posts\n##  [Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/09/08/katie-farrar-fulbright-2009-italy-2/)\nSep 8, 2022\n2nd entry: On February 12, 2010, I witnessed the first snowfall to blanket Rome since February 1986 (oddly enough,...\n##  [Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/09/08/katie-farrar-fulbright-2009-italy/)\nSep 8, 2022\n1st entry: It is difficult to put into words the sense of awe I feel daily living in Rome.

    "content": "# British Marshall Scholarship (United Kingdom)\nAbout\n[Marshall Scholarships](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/) finance young Americans of high ability to study for a degree in the United Kingdom. Up to fifty Scholars are selected each year to study at the graduate level at a UK institution in any field of study.\nAs future leaders, with a lasting understanding of British society, Marshall Scholars strengthen the enduring relationship between the British and American peoples, their governments, and their institutions. Marshall Scholars are talented, independent, and wide-ranging, and their time as Scholars enhances their intellectual and personal growth. Their direct engagement with Britain through its best academic programmes contributes to their ultimate personal success.\nThe program objectives are:\n  * To enable intellectually distinguished young Americans, their country\u2019s future leaders, to study in the UK;\n  * To help Scholars gain an understanding and appreciation of contemporary Britain;\n  * To contribute to the advancement of knowledge in science, technology, the humanities, the social sciences, and the creative arts at Britain\u2019s centres of academic excellence;\n  * To motivate Scholars to act as ambassadors from the USA to the UK and vice versa throughout their lives thus strengthening British American understanding;\n  * To promote the personal and academic fulfilment of each Scholar.\n\n\nWith over 2,000 alumni, Marshall Scholars come from all academic, cultural, socio-economic, and regional backgrounds, creating an inclusive community that you will be part of for a lifetime. Marshall Scholars have gone on to become Supreme Court Justices, Members of Congress, diplomats, educators, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, authors, musicians, filmmakers, scientists, and astronauts.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Marshall Scholarship places no limitations on your undergraduate major or field of study. Marshall Scholarships are awarded to students from all backgrounds in any academic discipline. The programme strives to promote a diverse pool of candidates drawn from a wide range of US colleges and universities. In recent years, minority students hold around 40% percent of the Scholarships, while more than one-third of successful candidates come from public universities.\nMarshall offers funding for one or two years. Many Marshall Scholars choose to complete two one-year master\u2019s programs, which are common in the U.K. Candidates are invited to indicate two preferred universities, although the Marshall Commission reserves the right to decide on final placement. Expressions of interest in studying at universities other than Oxford, Cambridge, and London institutions are particularly welcomed. Candidates are especially encouraged to consider the Marshall Partnership Universities. You can learn more about the U.K. university systems and search available graduate degrees at [Study in the U.K.](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/study-in-the-uk) on the Marshall Scholarship website.\nThe Marshall Commission does NOT fund the following courses: Second BA/BSc (undergraduate) Degrees; MBA (any university); MPhil Development Studies (University of Oxford only); MSc/MFE Financial Economics (any university); MSc Global Health Science and Epidemiology (University of Oxford only); MSc International Health and Tropical Medicine (University of Oxford only); MSc Law and Finance (University of Oxford only); MPP (Public Policy) (University of Oxford only); PG Diplomas/Certificates in any subject (any university); Degrees leading to professional qualifications in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science and law (these degrees typically take 5 years to complete); Distance Learning Degrees; Degrees that require extended periods away from the University or the UK, including joint degrees with Universities not in the UK; Supervised research not leading to a degree qualification (see **Fulbright Study/Research, above,** instead).\nOne year candidates must be registered for degrees that are 12 months in duration. Courses that run for 10 months or less (where the course ends before August) will not be funded on the one year Scholarship.\n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for SOP advising services on a Marshall application, an undergraduate student (or recent undergraduate alumni) must:\n  * be a junior (intending to graduate next academic year), a graduating senior (intending to graduate in the current academic year) or a recent undergraduate degree recipient from UCI within the past 12 months*;\n  * a citizen of the United States;\n  * have earned, and continue to maintain, a G.P.A. of at least 3.7;\n  * intend to begin enrollment in a graduate program exactly **two Fall terms in the future**(not in the upcoming Fall term of the calendar year of application).\n\n\n*If you are studying for a second bachelor\u2019s degree, please note that, if applying in Spring 2021, your first undergraduate degree must have been earned after April 2019.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThe Marshall Scholarship provides the following benefits:\n  * University fees,\n  * Cost of living expenses,\n  * Annual book grant,\n  * Thesis grant,\n  * Research and daily travel grants,\n  * Travel fares to and from the United States,\n  * and, where applicable, a contribution towards the support of a dependent spouse.\n\n\n### Recent Recipients and Finalists\n  * In 2015, [Felipe Hernandez](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/the-scholars/scholar-profiles/felipe-hern%C3%A1ndez) (Political Science, Music Performance) received a two-year Marshall Scholarship for study in the MEd in Educational Leadership, Policy and Development at the University of Bristol, and in the MSc in Comparative Social Policy at the University of Oxford.\n  * In 2014, [Kenneth Lai](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/2017/01/15/kenneth-lai-fulbright-recipient-marshall-finalist/) (English, Classics) was named a Finalist (and also received a Fulbright Study/Research grant for master\u2019s level study in Finland.)\n  * In 1995, Kelly Maglia (Drama, Music) received a Marshall Scholarship for study in theater arts and English at the University of London\u2019s Goldsmiths College.\n\n\n### Competitiveness\nThe Marshall Scholarship is highly competitive. In 2019-20, the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission regional selection committees reviewed 1,000 endorsed applications and interviewed 160 Finalists. The Commission awarded 40 two-year scholarships and 6 one-year scholarships.\nIn appointing Scholars the selectors will look for candidates who have the potential to excel as scholars, as leaders and as contributors to improved UK-US understanding. Assessment will be based on **academic merit, leadership potential,** and**ambassadorial potential.** Full descriptions of the selection criteria are available on the[ Marshall Scholarship website](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/apply/criteria-and-who-is-eligible).\nBesides exceeding the 3.7 G.P.A. requirement, SOP recommends curating a record of original and significant accomplishment in your discipline (such as presentations, publications, exhibits, or performances), as well as a record of significant leadership achievement in campus or off-campus organizations, before applying to the Marshall Scholarship. Most recent recipients participated in the [Campuswide Honors Collegium](http://honors.uci.edu/) and/or the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://www.urop.uci.edu/) and were also competitive for invitation to School-based Honors Programs.\n## Related Posts\n[Schwarzman Scholarship \\(Tsingua University, China\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\n##  [Schwarzman Scholarship (Tsingua University, China)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\nMay 25, 2022\nDesigned to prepare young leaders to deepen understanding between China and the rest of the world, Schwarzman Scholars is the first scholarship created to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st Century.

    "content": "# Beinecke Scholarship\n### Fields of Study\n**_Eligibility by UCI School: Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences_**\nApplicants must plan to enter a research-focused master\u2019s or doctoral program in the arts, humanities, or social sciences. Students in the social sciences who plan to pursue graduate study in neuroscience should not apply for a Beinecke Scholarship; nor should students applying for professional degrees that emphasize skills and practical analysis such as business, law, public health, public policy, and social work.\n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for nomination for a Beinecke Scholarship, a student must:\n  * Have demonstrated superior standards of intellectual ability, scholastic achievement, and personal promise during his or her undergraduate career.\n  * Be a college junior pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree during the current academic year. \u201cJunior\u201d means a student who plans to continue full-time undergraduate study and who expects to receive a baccalaureate degree between December and August of the subsequent (next) academic year.\n  * Be a U.S. citizen or a U.S. national from American Samoa or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n  * Have a documented history of receiving need-based financial aid during his or her undergraduate years. Primary evidence of meeting this criterion is a student\u2019s history of receiving need-based institutional, state, or federal grants-in-aid. Each nominated student will be required to complete a Financial Aid Data Sheet certifying that the student meets this criterion. During the selection process, the amount of financial need will be one of the factors considered, with preference being given to candidates for whom the awarding of a scholarship would significantly increase the likelihood of the student\u2019s being able to attend graduate school.\n  * Students who are selected to receive the Truman Scholarship will not be awarded the Beinecke Scholarship.\n\n\n### Scholarship Benefits\nEach scholar receives $4,000 immediately prior to entering graduate school and an additional $30,000 while attending graduate school. There are no geographic restrictions on the use of the scholarship, and recipients are allowed to supplement the award with other scholarships, assistantships, and research grants.\nScholars are encouraged to begin graduate study as soon as possible following graduation from college, and must utilize all of the funding within five years of completion of undergraduate studies. A scholar is allowed to take a one-year leave of absence immediately following graduation, but is normally expected to enter graduate school and begin receipt of the Beinecke funding in the following year. A scholar who receives a National Science Foundation, Marshall, Fulbright, Rhodes, Gates, or similar scholarship is allowed to postpone receipt of the Beinecke award until the student has completed study under those programs.\n### Competitiveness\nSOP recommends achieving a G.P.A. of at least 3.7 and curating a record of original and significant accomplishment in your discipline (such as presentations, publications, exhibits, or performances) before applying to the Beinecke Scholarship. Most nominees participated in the [Campuswide Honors Collegium](http://honors.uci.edu/) and the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://www.urop.uci.edu/) and were also competitive for invitation to School-based Honors Programs.\n## Related Posts\n[National Science Foundation \\(NSF\\) Graduate Research Fellowship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/national-science-foundation-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship/)\n##  [National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/national-science-foundation-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship/)\nMay 25, 2022\nFields of Study Eligibility by UCI School: Biological Sciences, Engineering, Information & Computer Science,...\n[Department of Defense SMART Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/department-of-defense-smart-undergraduate-scholarship/)\n##  [Department of Defense SMART Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/department-of-defense-smart-undergraduate-scholarship/)\nMay 25, 2022\nFields of Study Eligibility by UCI School: Biological Sciences, Engineering, Information & Computer Science,...\n[National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration \\(NOAA\\) Hollings Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/national-oceanic-atmospheric-administration-noaa-hollings-undergraduate-scholarship/)\n##  [National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hollings Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/national-oceanic-atmospheric-administration-noaa-hollings-undergraduate-scholarship/)\nMay 25, 2022\nFields of Study Eligibility by UCI School: Biological Sciences, Education, Engineering, Information & Computer...\n",

He worked on a variety of projects while at Irvine that included the economics of urban bus pollution, the study of graviton decay at the Large Hadron Collider, and the optimization of electrode design in microbial fuel cells. After graduating, John spent a year abroad in Norway as a Fulbright Scholar studying mercury pollution in the Arctic. He received_ a NSF _Graduate Research Fellowship upon returning and is currently in Caltech\u2019s environmental engineering_ PhD _program working on the chemistry of storing CO2 in the ocean as a means to combat climate change. In the future, John hopes to continue his research and work in environmental policy._\nRecently, we caught up with John Naviaux to ask him about his experiences after winning both the Fulbright in Norway, and the NSF. Below, are his thoughts, experiences and tips on how to apply and how to enjoy these unique experiences. He hopes that those contemplating either a Fulbright in research or the NSF will find his story helpful. He is also available to answer questions regarding his experiences. Please see below.\n**_Thank you for taking the time to talk to us about your experiences with SOP._**\nOf course. Anything for UCI and the SOP office.\n******_What Scholarships Did you Win? How did you Learn About Them?_**\n******Fulbright and NSF**.**** Both, with the help of the SOP office. I learned about them because the scholarship office was sending out targeted emails. I was also part of the UCI **CHP Honors Program,** and they were also sending out emails telling us we should apply for these scholarships, and reminding us that we had a valuable resource in SOP.\n**_How did you Work Together with SOP to figure Out Which Fellowships you Should Pursue?_****__**\nI was contacted by someone in SOP who told me, \u201cwith your GPA and your honors background, you should apply to these opportunities.\u201d I went in, and talked to them and they said they had a number of scholarships. We went over a few. The Rhodes scholarship, for example; I didn\u2019t apply to that one. Rhodes requires 6-8 letters of recommendation, and I only really had personal relationships with 3-4 professors who would be able to write strong letters.\nThen, there was the Fulbright and the NSF. Talking with SOP, we discussed what I had the best shot of winning. We went over my goals, and how my resume backed those up.\nAfter going back and forth, SOP recommended the Fulbright and the NSF. Along the way, I figured out that a lot of the scholarships have similar requirements. So, while I was initially interested in the Fulbright, I realized that I could write about my research experience and propose projects and future goals that would work well if I decided to apply for the NSF.\nSo I decided to pursue both. I went to the SOP office and we started working on my personal statement. I ended writing almost the same personal statement for the NSF. With SOP\u2019s suggestions and the work I had invested in the Fulbright application, I was able to adjust my applications, and incorporate tips that would be better for each.\n**_So, Did you Apply at the Same Time?_**\nI applied to both during the same year. That was part of the pitch that the scholarship office had: that all these things require similar applications, but not exactly the same, so I ended up working with one of my professors to have a different proposed project for the NSF than the one for the Fulbright, but the statement of purpose was very similar, with a similar research background and so I was able to change small things to apply for both.\n**_Were you a Junior or a Senior at the Time of Application?_**\nI was a senior when I applied. Part of the reason I applied then was that I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what I wanted to do after graduating. I thought grad school was a possibility, and this is what I\u2019m doing now, but I wasn\u2019t sure at the time and I wanted to apply to a lot of different opportunities and see what would work out. The SOP office pointed out that I could use my application to apply for graduate school, which was great, too.\nSOP\u2019s advice was invaluable in telling me, this works for this, this doesn\u2019t for this one, and reiterating by going back and forth what would make for the strongest application and how. They suggested to me, change this, change that. It was worth it. I was able to adjust my statements to write winning applications.\n**_How Did you Juggle the Fulbright and the NSF? Was there a Conflict of Timing?_**\nYes, but it ended up not being a problem. I found out about Fulbright, NSF and grad school all within a week of each other. They all want you to commit, so I talked with the different schools and the NSF director at each school along with the acceptance committee at each school and told them:\n_Look, I have all these things. I really want to do the Fulbright abroad in Norway. What can I do about this?_\nNone of these schools had a problem at all. They said, not a problem we will just defer your admittance until you get back. The NSF is a 5-year scholarship, but only 3 of the years are paid and 2 of the years are for deferring, so it worked out because I was able to defer for the first year because of the Fulbright. I also accepted the NSF, and accepted Caltech as my graduate school of choice. They fund you the first year there so I was able to defer again and once the school funding ran out, I was able to start the NSF funding.\nI was surprised by how easy the transitions were, and it really was because all these different academic communities are very supportive of these scholarships, and they want the students to have these things, so they were willing to work with me a lot in order for me to participate in all these different opportunities that did conflict in time, but worked out in the end.\nEvery school told me, yes, please go on your Fulbright. Come back. We will have a spot waiting for you. There was really no issue at all, especially for graduate school. They value their students having these experiences.\n**_So, What did you do for your Fulbright? Where did you go? What was your experience like, and for how long?_**\nMy Fulbright was 10 months long, and I went to Norway. I stayed in the middle section of Norway working with a professor who was studying the presence of mercury in the environment, which worked well because I was interested in the Arctic environment. One of the things that was intimidating to me was that you are supposed to come up with a research project. Other Fulbrighters that I knew did have specific research projects. But for me, I was an economics undergrad who later added an earth science focus, so I knew I wanted to do earth science-related things. To get started, I looked at countries that I was interested in, and one of them was Norway. I looked at what the faculty were doing there, and found this professor and started thinking of a project that would be suitable to my interests. I learned he was researching mercury pollution in the environment. I thought, this is perfect. I thought of Norway, specifically, because it is in the Arctic. I would have easy access to the Arctic and that was what I was interested in. I was able to work with this professor and come up with an idea as opposed to coming in with a project that I wanted to do from the very beginning.\n[Trondheim church \\(called Nidarosdomen\\) in winter](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/IMG_1538.jpg)\n**_Where Did you Stay? Did you have any Language Barriers?_**\nThis question relates to why I decided on Norway. When it comes to the Fulbright, there are tons of countries you can apply to that have language requirements and others don\u2019t. For me, I only speak English so that really cut out a bunch of countries. Like Germany and France, where you have to be fluent in those languages. Of English-speaking countries or with no language requirements there were: the UK, Australia, New Zealand and some Scandinavian countries. _Editor\u2019s Note: SOP maintains a list of countries with no language requirements that include other geographical regions._\nWhen it came to choosing, I was systematic about the countries that I applied to. In terms of the UK, I looked at the number of applicants that applied vs the number of spots available, and for the UK there is something like 10 spots for 300 plus applicants. I also wasn\u2019t interested in Australia or New Zealand. I looked at Scandinavian countries and they had a much smaller applicant pool per number of spots. The idea of going there, and the best odds for actually getting the scholarship influenced my decision.\n[I went back to Ny-\u00c5lesund later in the year and this time needed to cross-country ski around to collect water samples. The scenery was gorgeous!](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/IMG_2807.jpg)\nThey didn\u2019t have a language requirement and as it turns out, once I knew that I had the Fulbright, I contacted the university and they were able to get me international student housing.\n**_Did you have enough money from the award to pay for everything that you needed?_**\nI did. It varies based on the country so my stipend was probably not as generous in terms of cost of living that perhaps helps students in South American countries, but I did not have a problem and neither did the other Fulbrighters in the area. We had food and housing and transportation was all paid for, and the only times I spent any of my own money was doing extra trips. Even then, it was easy to budget without spending my own money.\n[ Some of my research in Norway was conducted in the research town of Ny-\u00c5lesund on the island of Svalbard. They had polar bear warning signs posted around the town.](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/IMG_0838.jpg)\n**_How long did it take you to adjust to Norway? Did you make friends right away? What was it like to adapt to a new society?_**\nIt was not difficult for me to adapt, partly because the Fulbright office is big on connecting you with other Fulbrighters, so the student body, and the location are two things to consider when applying and choosing a Fulbright location. I was in one of the universities where there were plenty of people who were my age and shared similar interests. And I was connected to the Fulbright organization and I learned there were 2 other Fulbrighters in my city. I got there and had an automatic network of Fulbrighters, and we did Fulbright events there. I\u2019m still really good friends with them. I went to one of their weddings recently.\nMeeting local students was also easy because I was in a university area. A contrasting story to mine: there was an English-teaching Fulbrighter who stayed in a really small town of like 200 people and it was harder to acclimate and get around. Someone\u2019s experience will definitely be based on where they are in a certain country. When people ask me, what I should consider? I tell them:\n_You should consider what you want to do research-wise, but you should also consider the experience of the area that you are going to be in._\n**_What was expected of you in terms of hours of work, and research projects, were you supposed to come up with something material by the time you concluded? Was a final presentation expected?_**\nThe Fulbright is very much a cultural exchange (in addition to the English-teaching or research exchange), so I am not sure how it is for other countries, but for the Norwegian experience, we had to write a mid-term report after 5 months. This was a 1-page statement saying, this is what we\u2019ve done, and this is how we are adjusting. They had no pressure on having any set work done, or any kind of deliverable. With that said, conferences were encouraged and some were exclusive to Fulbright students. At the end of the year, all Fulbrighters get together and get to present on what they\u2018ve been up to. These presentations could be travel, cultural, or research-based. So it was not stressful to get these extras done.\n****\n[Now for my PhD, here I am presenting for a field course at Caltech on glacial moraines at Convict Lake](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/10379918_10203714546518721_1562585893518264136_o.jpg)\n**_Do you feel that you became a better researcher or gained more depth with your topic? Were you taught well by your mentors there?_**\nYes, I would say it was an incredibly valuable experience. I learned a lot about the specific topic of mercury in the Arctic. I also found it valuable to conduct research outside of the U.S. It was interesting to learn how different cultures deal with research and how they present in different research styles. It was also valuable trying to translate myself into another language because as a primary English speaker I had not done that before.\n[Myself overlooking norway Trollstigen road](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/IMG_0273.jpg)\n**_What did you notice as the biggest difference between research in Norway and research in the US?_**\nTo be honest the biggest difference was work/life balance. It\u2019s kind of common in the US to have a 60 plus hour week. The stipend for similar work in Norway is not $30,000.\nIn Norway a graduate student is treated as a regular full-time researcher holding a 9-5 type job and the stipend is around $80,000. There are costs of living adjustments but research is treated as a full-time job and they are paid much more. I did not make that salary when I was in Norway. I got the US stipend.\nIt was interesting to see that the quality of research is very high, outputting a lot, while working significantly less. They really value productivity while you are at work, and once you are not, you no longer need to be at work.\n[Norway, City of Trondheim](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/IMG_0537.jpg)\nI was also exposed to different styles of presenting. In the US when you present your research it is very much a pitch: this is why your findings are great and amazing. In Norway the style is more, here are the facts. How effective you think my facts are is up to the audience. Just being exposed to all of this was very interesting.\n**_When you wrapped up the Fulbright you moved into the NSF opportunity. How did the transition take place?_**\nI accepted the NSF at the same time I accepted the Fulbright. I was able to postpone it until grad school. It was really easy. Every year, they send you a message: please update your NSF status, so when I started grad school at Caltech I filled out the update and pressed the button to activate my status. And that was it.\n[Rainbow over Norwegian area of Valldal](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2016/12/IMG_0232.jpg)\n**_So once the NSF gives you the funding for graduate school, are there specific research expectations due to them?_**\nNo. It is pretty much a blank check. When completing their application, you have to come up with a research project and plan. It does not have to be related at all with what you will end up doing. When I applied to the NSF, I was working in a microbial cell lab at UCI.\nSo my project/pitch was based on doing more research in this area. What I\u2019m doing is important. What I plan to do in the future is this. But, once I got to Caltech I decided, okay, I\u2019m not planning on that anymore but NSF does not care about that. Once you have proven that you are capable of thinking of a strong research idea and writing out a plan for it, once you get the award, they trust you will continue coming up with new research ideas that are not necessarily the same as the one you originally proposed.\nEach year I write a quick paragraph or so updating the NSF on what I\u2019ve done in the previous year. For my first year in Caltech, I wasn\u2019t doing much research so for my update I told them I\u2019ve been taking classes and started new projects. So now that I\u2019m doing more research my updates are more research related. I\u2019m working on ocean chemistry now. I\u2019m still getting paid by the NSF, but it\u2019s not related to my application at all. There is no expectation that it has to be.\n**_What do you want to do with your degree?_**\nFor graduate school, I chose the California Institute of Technology. I\u2019m getting my Ph.D. in Environmental Science and Engineering. I had several ideas that potentially interest me. Part of my research is doing ocean chemistry for CO2 capture. The idea is coming up with a way to take out CO2 out of the environment to combat global warming.\nWe are trying to start up a company based on the work we\u2018ve done to capture CO2 and put it into the ocean and store it there without changing the ocean chemistry. We are setting this up. We are exploring the possibility of a start-up company that works on this topic, which is a popular thing to do. There is also another possibility of working for government research labs or major companies. My approach so far is to see what opportunities come up.\n**_How influential would you say that the Fulbright and the NSF have been to your development?_**\nThe NSF is invaluable. If you are a student and you have an NSF you can work pretty much at any university. Any university would want you as a student and any professor will work with you because you are free. As soon as you say that you have an NSF in your application all doors are open to you and you can do whatever you want with whoever you want. There are different professors who might turn away a student because the reality of funding in the academic world. \u201cI\u2019d like to work with you but, I can\u2019t pay you.\u201d But with the NSF you are paid for 3 years, so if you have your own research ideas a professor would support you because you are free or you\u2019ll hop onto their project and they\u2019ll love that because you are free. So, the NSF allowed me to switch between professors without any problems at all.\nThe Fulbright was also valuable in making your application stand out more. I would consider the Fulbright as an invaluable life experience. I wouldn\u2019t trade that for anything. That was one of the best 10 months of my life. It was probably not a huge research contributor because I\u2019m doing different research. But, it reinforced the idea that this was the field of study that I was interested in. I was developing my interests in environmental health safety kind of research.\n**_What Tips would you share with a Student Contemplating the Fulbright or the NSF_****?**\nGo for it. It may be intimidating to apply to multiple scholarships, but with a small amount of extra work I was able to apply to multiple opportunities. You don\u2019t have anything to lose by applying. The worst thing that can happen is that you write your strongest application yet. You can always use it to apply for other opportunities, including graduate school. If you get it, then you\u2019ll have an amazing experience living and studying in another country. Also, with the NSF you can do whatever you want, research-wise. Some Fulbrighters don\u2019t go to graduate school, so it is not a requirement. Still, being paid to live and work in another country can be an incredible experience.\n**_What Tips can you Offer for the Application Process?_**\nRegarding the personal statement, I would listen to you guys in the scholarship office. I struggle a lot with personal statements. I had to rewrite mine like 10 times. Writing personal statements is a different experience for me. It is not how I write.\nThe other parts of the process depend on the student. I was pragmatic about the whole thing. For example, I can only speak English; I want to research in environmental science; I want the best options to get in. I looked at acceptance ratios and studied my chances to get in. I struggled between Norway and Sweden because both had interesting environmental programs, but I went with Norway because my chances to gain acceptance were higher. I knew that if I applied to Sweden and I didn\u2019t get it, I would have kicked myself for missing a study abroad opportunity. If I didn\u2019t go with the option that gave me the best chance, I would be very sad. Not everyone wants to be that pragmatic, though. Some people have a dream: I want to go to place x, and this is why. To them I would say, go for your dream. My goal was to study abroad in an environmental field. I looked at Norway\u2019s universities and the faculty there and looked for what was most interesting to me.\n**_What about Professor\u2019s Letters?_**\nPlan ahead! Once I knew I wanted to pursue this, I started cultivating relations with professors more intentionally. Since I was working with professors doing research already, that was one letter. A summer before I had worked with another so that was another letter. For my third, I started going to my organic chemistry professor\u2019s office hours. Talking to her more about what I wanted to do and explaining my back story. I told her, I\u2019m interested in doing this would you be willing to write a letter if we get to know each other and she agreed.\n**_Thanks, SOP!_**\nSOP\u2019s help worked very nicely for me and my application process. Once I knew I wanted to apply it got easier.

    "content": "# Killam Fellowship (Canada)\n### About\nThe [Killam Fellowships Program](https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships/americans/how-to-apply) provides funding for exceptional undergraduate students to study in Canada for either one term ($5,000) or a full academic year ($10,000). The goal of the program is to increase mutual understanding between Canada and the United States of America. The fellowship includes a number of enrichment opportunities covered by the Killam Mobility Program, including the Fall Orientation, a Cultural Awareness Grant, and the Spring Seminar.\nThe Killam Fellowship application is supplemental to your study abroad applications. As of Fall 2020, the UCI Scholarship Opportunities Program (SOP) offers advising and nomination for Killam Fellows applicants to McGill University (UCEAP direct exchange) only, although more Canadian universities may be added in subsequent years.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Killam Fellowship Program places no limitations on the applicant\u2019s major or field of study. However, you should be able to identify relevant coursework at McGill University that you would like to undertake to earn UCEAP units toward your UCI undergraduate degree program. An Academic Advisor in your UCI School/major will need to approve your course selections for your study abroad plan.\nN.B. If McGill University is not the right choice for your academic interests and plans, consider applying to the Killam Fellowship on your own through the Open Competition, without SOP endorsement. Please see \u201cOpen Competition\u201d on the [Killam Fellowships: How to Apply website](https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships/americans/how-to-apply) for guidelines.\n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for SOP advising and endorsement, Killam Fellows Direct Exchange applicants must:\n  * be full-time, enrolled undergraduate sophomores (graduating two academic years from now) or juniors (graduating one academic year from now);\n  * be a citizen of the United States of America;\n  * intend to concurrently apply, through the UCI Office of Global Engagement Study Abroad Center, to study abroad at McGill University (through UCEAP direct exchange);\n  * have a strong academic record and meet all eligibility requirements and regulations of the home university for participation in UCEAP;\n  * be proficient in English.\n\n\nFor guidelines on preparing your Study Abroad application, please see [How to Study Abroad](https://studyabroad.uci.edu/how-to-study-abroad/).\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThe Killam Fellowships Program provides:\n  * a cash award of $5,000 US per semester ($10,000 for a full academic year);\n  * a three-day Fall orientation in Ottawa and a three-day Spring seminar in Washington;\n  * an allowance of $250 CA to offset the cost of health insurance.\n\n\nAll Killam Fellows are also eligible to apply for a mobility (in-country travel) grant in an amount not to exceed $800 Cdn. The idea of the mobility initiative is to allow students to undertake an educational field trip, providing the Fellows with the opportunity to gain a fuller understanding of the culture in Canada. Killam alumni are also eligible to apply for various [enrichment opportunities](https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships/enrichment-opportunities.html) such as the Fulbright Canada Alumni Internship Program, the Killam Community Action Initiative, and the Local Ambassador Program.\n### Recent Recipients & Honorable Mentions\nKillam reviewers seek to identify undergraduates who demonstrate a passion for research and who exhibit the creative spark that will make them leaders in their fields.\n  * In 2023, Joshua Nguyen (Public Health) received a Killam Scholarship.\n\n\n### Competitiveness\nUCI may nominate three undergraduates intending to study abroad, through Direct Exchange (UCEAP), at McGill University. The ideal candidate has excellent academic performance, a strong interest in cross-cultural exchange, and can articulate a compelling reason for choosing to go to Canada, and specifically to McGill, to study abroad in the subsequent (next) academic year.\n## Related Posts\n[Schwarzman Scholarship \\(Tsingua University, China\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\n##  [Schwarzman Scholarship (Tsingua University, China)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\nMay 25, 2022\nDesigned to prepare young leaders to deepen understanding between China and the rest of the world, Schwarzman Scholars is the first scholarship created to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st Century.

    "content": "# Schwarzman Scholarship (Tsingua University, China)\n### [](https://en.sc.tsinghua.edu.cn/Admissions.htm#03)About\nDesigned to prepare young leaders to deepen understanding between China and the rest of the world, [Schwarzman Scholars](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/) is the first scholarship created to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st Century. Whether in politics, business, or science, the success of future leaders around the world will depend upon an understanding of China\u2019s role in global trends.\nThe Schwarzman Scholars experience is anchored in a rigorous and innovative Master\u2019s of Global Affairs degree program at Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of the country\u2019s leading universities.\nStudents spend a year immersed in an international community of thinkers, innovators, and senior leaders in business, politics, and society. In an environment of intellectual engagement, professional development, and cultural exchange, they learn from one another and pursue their academic disciplines while building their leadership capacities. This experience will expand students\u2019 understanding of the world and create a growing network of global leaders that will build strong ties between China and the rest of the world.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Schwarzman Scholars program places no restrictions on your undergraduate major or field of study. The program has had many successful applicants from science, engineering, and the humanities in addition to the social sciences and business.\nSchwarzman Scholars pursue a **one-year Masters in Global Affairs** , working with an academic advisor to design an academic plan that best suits his or her academic and professional goals. Drawing on the best traditions of Tsinghua and top academic institutions around the world, the curriculum bridges the academic and professional worlds to educate students about leadership and about China\u2019s expanding role in the world.\nThe program of study, including all required courses and activities, is one year, beginning with mandatory orientation in late August and concluding with a graduation ceremony early the following July.\nThe [program\u2019s curriculum](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/program/student-experience/) has been designed to build students\u2019 leadership abilities and deepen their knowledge of China and global affairs. The program also provides Scholars with unparalleled learning opportunities with leaders from China and the world through high-level interactions at lectures, an internship program, a mentors network, and intensive deep-dive travel seminars.\n**Core Curriculum:** All Schwarzman Scholars share a core curriculum that serves as an anchor for the rest of their studies and builds connections among them as a cohort. In addition to the core curriculum, Scholars are able to choose elective courses from a variety of academic disciplines, mainly but not exclusively from the fields of economics, public policy, and international relations, many with a specific or comparative focus on China. Scholars can focus their electives in one of these fields, if desired.\n**Leadership Development:** Leadership development is woven throughout the Schwarzman Scholars program from Orientation through the academic year and embedded in alumni programming after Scholars leave the College. To provide a foundation for the interactions students will have with mentors and through internships, the program offers courses and skills building workshops focused specifically on leadership development. Scholars will choose between several leadership courses, which have been designed to analyze leadership from interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives and different career perspectives (public, private, and non-profit).\n**Mentoring:** Each student will have the opportunity to work closely with a senior mentor. Leading members of the Beijing business, academic, government, and NGO communities will help advance students\u2019 understanding of Chinese society, culture, and career paths as well as support personal growth.\n**Internships:** Schwarzman optional internships provide an opportunity for students to pursue their particular interests and learning goals, and develop their first-hand experience and understanding of leadership and China, in a setting outside the College. Students may arrange an internship on their own or reference the job portal for intern and volunteer opportunities available during their time in the program. Organizations may include businesses, state-owned enterprises, international organizations, non-governmental agencies, schools, etc.\n**Capstone Project:** The Capstone Project is a requirement for Scholars to complete their program. The project is the culmination of students\u2019 Schwarzman College experience and a final presentation of students\u2019 experience, learning, and growth in their one-year residence and study. There are three Capstone project options: a research paper, a case study, or a policy analysis.\n**Language:** All international students take required Mandarin classes, and Chinese students will take advanced English language classes.\nMore detailed information about the program curriculum is on the [Schwarzman website.](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/program-experience/curriculum/)\n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for SOP advising services on a Schwarzman Scholars application, an undergraduate student (or recent undergraduate alumni) must:\n  * be a junior (intending to graduate next academic year), a graduating senior (intending to graduate in the current academic year) or a recent undergraduate degree recipient from UCI within the past 12 months;\n  * be at least 18 but not yet 28 years of age;\n  * intend to begin enrollment in a graduate program exactly **two Fall terms in the future**(not in the upcoming Fall term of the calendar year of application);\n  * have never previously enrolled in, nor earned, a doctoral degree in any field.\n\n\nThere are no citizenship restrictions. However, students who hold passports from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and/or Macau must apply within the [Schwarzman Scholars Chinese Admissions Portal](https://en.sc.tsinghua.edu.cn/Admissions.htm#03 \"https://en.sc.tsinghua.edu.cn/admissions.htm#03\"), which has a late-May deadline, consistent with most graduate admissions processes in China.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nSchwarzman Scholars receive a comprehensive scholarship, including:\n  * Tuition Fees;\n  * Room and board;\n  * Travel to and from Beijing at the beginning and end of the academic year;\n  * An in-country study tour;\n  * Required course books and supplies;\n  * Health insurance;\n  * A stipend of $4,000 for personal expenses.\n\n\nSchwarzman Scholars also have access to shared study facilities and other benefits of [Schwarzman College.](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/program-experience/student-life/)\n### Recent Recipients\n  * In 2018-19, Brandon Finger (Electrical Engineering) was named a Semi-Finalist.\n  * In 2016-17, Cassie Zhang (Economics, International Studies) was named an Alternate (waitlisted for funding), and Stella Liu (International Studies) was named a Semi-Finalist.\n\n\nBrief biographies are available on our [Scholarship Recipients page](https://scholars.uci.edu/scholarship-recipients/).\n### Competitiveness\nSchwarzman Scholars is highly competitive. In 2020, Schwarzman Scholars reviewed 4,700 applications for 145 offers of admission.\nThe Schwarzman Scholars global selection committee reads each application carefully, examining academic abilities and leadership potential, and considers all of the required application components equally in making a holistic evaluation of each candidate. Leadership is the focus of the selection process, and all parts of the application should reinforce the candidate\u2019s profile as a young leader in her/his field and culture.\nSemi-finalists (those short-listed for admissions) will be notified by late October and invited to interview in July (passport holders from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau) or mid-November (U.S. and all other countries of citizenship).\n**Academic Excellence:** Applicants are expected to have demonstrated agility and superior performance in their academic studies, and the most competitive candidates will be among the top students in their graduating class. Our assessment of candidates\u2019 academic abilities draws on global experts who know a variety of grading systems and academic cultures in different world regions.\n**Leadership Potential:** The Schwarzman Scholars selection process strives to understand candidates as individuals and to assess them within their own academic, professional, and cultural contexts. This applies to our assessment of applicants\u2019 leadership potential. We look at essays, in particular the leadership essay, and at the letters of recommendation as key tools in understanding an applicant\u2019s personal experience and approach to leadership. We want candidates to provide specific examples of their leadership that explore their abilities to understand challenges and opportunities, envision solutions, take initiative to act, inspire others to join an effort, and push through resistance and/or challenges to reach results.\nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that applicants achieve at least a 3.7 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of noteworthy accomplishment, professional competence, and dedication to ambitious career goals in public service, international business or trade, or academia. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of leadership or mentoring roles in academic, extracurricular, or service organizations; publications or performances; and/or significant work experience/internships relevant to the stated career goals.\n## Related Posts\n[Rhodes Scholarship \\(Oxford University, United Kingdom\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/rhodes-scholarship-oxford-university-united-kingdom/)\n##  [Rhodes Scholarship (Oxford University, United Kingdom)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/rhodes-scholarship-oxford-university-united-kingdom/)\nMay 25, 2022\nThe Rhodes Scholarship is the oldest (first awarded in 1902) and perhaps most prestigious international scholarship programme, enabling outstanding young people from around the world to study at the University of Oxford.\n[George Mitchell Scholarship \\(Ireland\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/george-mitchell-scholarship-ireland/)\n##  [George Mitchell Scholarship (Ireland)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/george-mitchell-scholarship-ireland/)\nMay 25, 2022\nThe George J.

    "content": "# Harry S. Truman Scholarship for Public Service\n### About\nThe [Harry S. Truman Scholarship](https://www.truman.gov/) Foundation\u2014the federal memorial to our thirty-third President\u2014awards merit-based scholarships to college students who plan to pursue careers in government or elsewhere in public service. Truman Scholars receive up to $30,000 for graduate or professional school, participate in leadership development activities, and have special opportunities for internships and employment with the federal government.\nThe Foundation defines **public service** as employment in government at any level, uniformed services, public-interest organizations, nongovernmental research and/or educational organizations, public and private schools, and public service-oriented nonprofit organizations.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Truman Foundation places no limitations on the applicant\u2019s field of study or major, as long as you can relate your academic interests to particular public service career objectives.\nMany recipients major in economics, political science, or history, and law or public policy are common fields of intended graduate study. However, students in a wide range of majors may be strong candidates because a wide variety of disciplines prepare students for careers in public service. Students majoring in such fields as chemistry, engineering, environmental studies, foreign languages, mathematics, and computer sciences (among others) are encouraged to apply.\nThe Foundation has supported Truman Scholars in many fields of study, from agriculture, biology, engineering, technology, medicine, and environmental management, to fields such as economics, education, government, history, international relations, law, political science, public administration, nonprofit management, public health, and public policy.\n### Eligibility\nEach nominee for the Truman Scholarship must be:\n  * a full-time junior-level student at a four-year institution pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree during the year of the scholarship application. \u2018Junior\u2019 here means a student who plans to continue full-time undergraduate study and who expects to receive a baccalaureate degree in the year following their scholarship application, or a student in his or her third year of collegiate study who expects to graduate in the year following their scholarship application;\n  * nominated by the Truman Scholarship Faculty Representative at his or her institution;\n  * in the upper quarter of his or her class; and\n  * a United States citizen or a United States national from American Samoa. Resident aliens (green card holders) are not eligible.\n\n\nA good candidate for the Truman Scholarship meets the above eligibility requirements and also:\n  * has an extensive record of public and community service;\n  * has outstanding leadership potential and communication skills; and\n  * is committed to a career in government or elsewhere in public service, as defined by the Foundation.\n\n\nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that applicants achieve at least a 3.7 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of noteworthy accomplishment, professional competence, and dedication to ambitious career goals in public service and governance, nonprofit leadership, or education. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of leadership or founding roles in extracurricular or service organizations; extensive volunteer service experience; formal participation in political campaigns or sustained activism for causes; military service; and/or significant work experience/internships relevant to the stated career goals.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThe Foundation provides:\n  * Up to $30,000 toward a public service-related graduate degree.\n  * **Truman Scholars Leadership Week**. This event, held at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, introduces new Scholars to the services provided by the Foundation and the many pathways to public service. Scholars participate in seminars and workshops with distinguished Truman alumni and other public service leaders, a group exercise about policy implementation, a graduate school and career fair with representatives from the schools and programs most attended by Truman Scholars, and community service events in the Kansas City area; this event is required of all Scholars.\n  * **Summer Institute**. Immediately after college graduation, Scholars have the opportunity to participate in an eight-week Summer Institute in Washington, DC. The Foundation helps to arrange internships with government agencies and nonprofit organizations, seminars and workshops, meetings with Washington policymakers and Truman alumni, and opportunities for community building among Scholars.\n  * **Truman-Albright and Other Fellows Program**. After Summer Institute, Scholars may elect to stay in Washington, DC, for a full year in the Truman-Albright Fellows Program; Truman-Albright Fellows are placed in public service jobs while participating in workshops, seminars, and mentoring opportunities. Additional fellowship opportunities, outlined on the Truman website, are available for Scholars as they move through the early stages of their careers in public service.\n\n\nThe award may be used only for tuition, fees, books, room and board, or other specifically approved expenses. Payments from the Foundation may be received to supplement, but not to duplicate, benefits from the educational institution or from other foundations, institutions, or organizations. The combined benefits from all sources may not exceed the costs of tuition, fees, books, and room and board as prescribed by the institution.\nScholars may defer, for up to four years, Foundation support for their graduate studies after completion of their undergraduate studies. Scholars in graduate study programs supported by other means and Scholars in the Armed Forces may request additional years of deferral.\n### Service Requirement\nScholars are required to work in public service for three of the seven years following completion of a Foundation-funded graduate degree program as a condition of receiving funding. Scholars who are not employed in public service for a total of three years, or who fail to provide proof to the Foundation of such employment, will be required to repay any funds received along with interest. The Foundation will have an appeals process for those Scholars in special circumstances.\nThe Foundation may withhold or terminate a scholarship due to unsatisfactory academic performance or failure, as judged by the Foundation, to prepare specifically for a career in public service.\n### Recent Recipients & Finalists\nEach UCI undergraduate who has pursued the Truman Scholarship has had a unique profile of practical, sustained engagement in group leadership. However, there are some common trends, such as participation in student government through the Associated Students of UCI and in off-campus internship experiences related to the student\u2019s intended career field, often, but not always, undertaken through the UCDC or UC Sacramento programs.\nUCI Truman Scholars have also typically been affiliated with a leadership development program, such as the Campuswide Honors Collegium or the Student Achievement Guided by Experience (SAGE) program. Finally, while some may have been considered \u201cwell-rounded\u201d individuals, each Truman Scholar\u2019s service and leadership activities were generally concentrated on a particular issue or topic about which they were very passionate, allowing the student to articulate a narrative of intentional action and progressive success.\n  * In 2021-22, Steven Gong was declared a Finalist.\n  * In 2015, Daniela Estrada (Political Science) received a Truman Scholarship, and Julian Bugarin (Political Science and History) was declared a Finalist.\n  * In 2014, Sanaa Khan (International Studies) was declared a Finalist.\n  * In 2012, Felipe Hernandez (Political Science and Music Performance) received a Truman Scholarship.\n  * In 2006, Mukul Kumar (History) received a Truman Scholarship.\n  * In 2005, Vanessa Zuabi (Political Science and International Studies) was declared a Finalist.\n  * In 2004, Jacqueline Chattopadhyay (Economics and Political Science) received a Truman Scholarship.\n\n\n### Competitiveness\nCandidates must first be nominated by the Truman Faculty Representative at their institution. Each accredited four-year institution may nominate up to four students. Four-year institutions may also nominate three additional students who completed academic work at another institution.\nSemifinalists are selected nationally from university nominations, and are interviewed by Regional Review Panels composed of scholars and public officials. Each Panel recommends two people per state, plus up to six candidates for Scholars-at-Large.\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Truman Foundation, applicants selected for interview \u201cshow a long history of involvement in what the program seeks to reward (public service and government activities), have exerted leadership, have fine academic achievements, reveal some unique and interesting (preferably memorable) aspects about themselves and their experiences, provide a graduate school proposal that makes sense, prepare a carefully thought out and well-researched public policy analysis,\u201d write well, and have strong letters of reference.\nIn 2019, the Foundation selected 62 Truman Scholars from among 840 applications forwarded by over 346 colleges and universities. Scholars were chosen by 16 selection panels on the basis of leadership potential, intellectual ability, and the likelihood of \u201cmaking a difference.\u201d Each panel typically included a university president, a federal judge, a distinguished public servant, and a past Truman Scholarship winner.\nIn 2021, one scholarship will be available to a qualified resident nominee in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and, considered as a single entity, the Islands: Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. (Residency is generally determined by home address for school registration, family\u2019s primary residence, and voter registration.) The Foundation may select up to 15 at-large Scholars in 2021.\n## Related Posts\n[Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/paul-daisy-soros-fellowship-for-new-americans/)\n##  [Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/paul-daisy-soros-fellowship-for-new-americans/)\nMay 25, 2022\nAbout The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans is a $90,000 merit-based fellowship exclusively for...\n[Knight-Hennessy Scholarship at Stanford University](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/knight-hennessy-scholarship-at-stanford-university/)\n##  [Knight-Hennessy Scholarship at Stanford University](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/knight-hennessy-scholarship-at-stanford-university/)\nMay 25, 2022\nAbout The Knight-Hennessy Scholars program cultivates a diverse, multidisciplinary community of emerging leaders from...\n[Donald A.

    "content": "# Valerie Dao: Fulbright 2009 (Vietnam)\nAt an international education conference, third from right\nThe first night I arrived in Ho Chi Minh City was an experience that I will never forget. The moment the sliding glass doors opened and I stepped out of the airport, I was completely overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of the city. Once I managed to get a cab and head to my temporary home, the realization that this would be the next 10 months of my life quickly sunk in. I had lived in Orange County my entire life and Ho Chi Minh City could not be further from the comforts of home. The stark contrast in terms of infrastructure and severe lack of resources intimidated me and made me question how effective my contributions could really be to this developing country. Staring out of the back window of the cab, watching the swarms of motorbikes weave in and out of traffic, I wondered:  _what am I doing here?_\nThe next day, sitting on the concrete floor of my cousins\u2019 living room, I got my answer. I had just met my cousin Chau who is 15 years old and a sophomore in high school. We were having the standard get-to-know-one-another conversation, until I asked her if she knew what she wanted to do in the future. She paused for a second, and then explained that her dream was to go to the U.S. and study because she just wanted to learn how to think for herself. Nothing about what she said was particularly surprising\u2014but the fact that it was not made it that much more poignant in my mind. Her candid response was a swift reminder of why this research was so important to me in the first place. There are so many young students who face the same challenges and are simply not being provided the quality of education that they deserve, from both public and private perspectives.\nValerie\u2019s students at HUFLIT University\nSince then, I have been working hard trying to realize the initial goals that I set out for myself and my project prior to arrival. I am currently conducting my research through Dai Hoc Suu Pham, the University of Pedagogy in Ho Chi Minh City and HUFLIT (Ho Chi Minh City University of Foreign Languages and Information Technology), where I am a guest lecturer. Like any research project, implementing my project, a tracer study of successfully employed university graduates, has proven to be both challenging and frustrating. However, each day that I spend here is more rewarding than the last. Every day I have the chance to be at the forefront of the change that is transforming this country. Going to international education conferences, hearing from government officials from the Ministry of Education and Training, establishing my own research mentorship program and experiencing a completely different academic culture first hand, are all unique opportunities that I could not experience elsewhere. I am looking forward to being able to share these experiences with the students of UCI through my entries on this blog.\nAt a consulate dinner with Ken Fairfax, U.S. consul general in Ho Chi Minh City, and other Fulbright Scholars\n## Related Posts\n##  [Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/09/08/katie-farrar-fulbright-2009-italy-2/)\nSep 8, 2022\n2nd entry: On February 12, 2010, I witnessed the first snowfall to blanket Rome since February 1986 (oddly enough,...\n##  [Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/09/08/katie-farrar-fulbright-2009-italy/)\nSep 8, 2022\n1st entry: It is difficult to put into words the sense of awe I feel daily living in Rome.

    "content": "# Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)\nKatie in front of the Colosseo-Roma-Italia\n1st entry: It is difficult to put into words the sense of awe I feel daily living in Rome. The Fulbright scholarship I received for Art History has taken me to parts of the city that few (if any) travelers ever see: national libraries, private collections of rare books, art collections once owned by the most powerful families in Renaissance and Baroque Rome, archives of the academies, and small churches never mentioned in guidebooks. And my research marks only the beginning of the life I have built here.\nI had a rough beginning to moving halfway across the world. Thinking I had properly notified my banks before going abroad, I traveled without any cash with the intention of using an ATM upon my arrival. What a mistake! All three of my credit card accounts froze as soon I tried to use them. Unable to pay for a shuttle or taxi from the airport, I was forced to take the train to the metro to a bus\u2014with three large suitcases in tow\u2014to arrive at my friend\u2019s apartment in Rome. Did I mention that escalators and elevators are few and far between in Italy? It was, hands down, the most stressful traveling experience in my life.\nI spent Thanksgiving at an agriturismo in the Tuscan countryside; celebrated Christmas with an Italian family followed by midnight mass at St Peter\u2019s Basilica; and watched the endless explosions of fireworks in Piazza del Popolo on New Years Eve in Rome. Long weekends have allowed me to explore numerous Italian towns: Perugia, Cortona, Arrezzo, Bologna, Ravenna, Genoa, Cinque Terre, and Torino. My wanderlust, ever encouraged by the proliferation of low-cost airlines, has even swept me off to Prague, Budapest, and Istanbul. Living abroad provides an education unlike any other. It teaches you how to open your eyes, and heart, to the world.\nIt did not take long for my situation to improve, however. I quickly found a room in an apartment in Trastevere, one of my favorite neighborhoods in Rome. Because I also studied abroad in Rome in 2006, adjusting to the Italian lifestyle was fairly effortless for me. I love living without a car and walking everywhere; I grocery shop every other day instead of once a week; and in place of an enormous latte I drink several shots of espresso throughout the day. However, I still cannot help but become slightly frustrated when I need to buy something on a Sunday and every shop is closed, or when I find myself in a mob where there should be a queue, or when the bus fails to show up. But ultimately it is these little moments that teach me patience, so I am grateful for them. I have been so fortunate to meet a wonderful group of people through the Fulbright network, and I have befriended a group of Italians who integrate me into their local culture. Dinner parties are never wanting!\nOne of my favorite things about Italian culture is how much they value conversation and hospitality. Instead of rushing through meals, they take time to enjoy each other\u2019s company to the fullest. The best (and longest) dinner I have ever attended was in the company of an Italian family and several friends on the day of a Roma soccer game. While feasting on our four-course meal straight from mamma\u2019s kitchen, chatting about everything from casinos in Las Vegas to snowstorms in northern Italy, the game was playing on TV in the corner of the room. The teams\u2014Roma and Juventus\u2014were tied for most of the match, but at the last minute Roma scored the winning goal. The boys got so excited that the entire table began to shake from their frantic gesturing; wine was spilling, silverware was clattering, and everyone was erupting in laughter! Thousands of miles away from my own family and friends, I felt so at home.\nI spent Thanksgiving at an  _agriturismo_ in the Tuscan countryside; celebrated Christmas with an Italian family followed by midnight mass at St Peter\u2019s Basilica; and watched the endless explosions of fireworks in Piazza del Popolo on New Years Eve in Rome. Long weekends have allowed me to explore numerous Italian towns: Perugia, Cortona, Arrezzo, Bologna, Ravenna, Genoa, Cinque Terre, and Torino.

    "content": "# Rhodes Scholarship (Oxford University, United Kingdom)\n### About\nThe [Rhodes Scholarship](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholarships/the-rhodes-scholarship/) is the oldest (first awarded in 1902) and perhaps most prestigious international scholarship programme, enabling outstanding young people from around the world to study at the University of Oxford.\n  * Application to the U.S. or Global Rhodes constituencies require mandatory participation in the Trailblazer\u2019s 10 (Spring/Summer) advising process, under the guidance of an SOP Primary Advisor.\n  * Campus Endorsement is required for applicants to the U.S. and Global Rhodes constituencies only.\n  * _Endorsement is not available for applicants from the following Rhodes constituencies: Australia, Bermuda, Canada, China, East Africa, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Jamaica and the Commonwealth Caribbean, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Southern Africa, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, West Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. A constituency is a country, a group of countries, and/or territories, and/or states for the purposes of administering scholarships. The list of Rhodes constituencies and the countries they cover (where relevant) can be found[here](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholarships/list-of-rhodes-scholarship-constituencies/)._\n\n\nOne of the founding aims of the Scholarship was to identify young leaders from around the world who, through the pursuit of education together at Oxford, would forge bonds of mutual understanding and fellowship for the betterment of mankind. Although the language is old-fashioned, this remains one of the founding aims of the Scholarship: to select outstanding young people, with the potential to lead, who will make an impact for good in the world in later life.\nThe Scholarship is not just a financial bursary, it is a life-changing opportunity for exceptional young people with the potential to make a difference for good in the world. Rhodes Scholars are people who have a vision of how the world could be better as well as the energy to make a difference \u2013 whatever their sphere of interest. Rhodes alumni have distinguished themselves in every field \u2014 see [Scholar Stories](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/impact/scholar-stories/) and the ways in which [Scholars are standing up for the world](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/impact/standing-up-for-the-world/).\nThe fellowship of Rhodes Scholars, worldwide and across generations, is active and over 7,000 strong. Rhodes Scholars therefore enter a life-long fellowship with ongoing opportunities to connect with current and Senior Scholars and, beyond that, a warm and engaging community among Scholars typically develop enduring friendships. The Rhodes Scholarship opens up opportunities for Scholars before, after, and during their time in Oxford.\nEach year, 32 young students from the United States are selected as Rhodes Scholars through a decentralized process representing the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Rhodes Scholarship places no limitations on your undergraduate major or field of study.\nRhodes Scholars may read for any full-time postgraduate degree at the University of Oxford, subject to the few Rhodes requirements outlined below. The Rhodes Scholarship is for not less than two years.\nPermitted degrees/degree combinations:\n  * A BA with Senior Status (i.e. done over two years, rather than the normal three).\n  * A one-year taught Master\u2019s course (MSc, MSt, BCL), followed in the second year by another one-year taught Master\u2019s course.\n  * A one-year taught Master\u2019s course (MSc, MSt, BCL).\n  * A two-year MPhil or BPhil (or BCL/MPhil).\n  * A two-year MSc by research (or MLitt).\n  * A three-year DPhil.\n\n\nIn certain cases, at the discretion of the Academic Committee of the Rhodes Trust and the Rhodes Trustees, Scholars may apply for a third year of Scholarship to complete the DPhil. Notes on who may apply for a third year, as well as ineligible programs of study, are available under [Conditions of Tenure](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/media/42584/final-conditions-of-tenure2019-20.pdf) on the Rhodes website.\n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for SOP advising services on a Rhodes application, an undergraduate student (or recent undergraduate alumni) must:\n  * be a junior (intending to graduate in the next academic year), a graduating senior (intending to graduate in the current academic year) or a recent undergraduate degree recipient from UCI within the past 12 months*;\n  * have earned, and continue to maintain, a G.P.A. of at least 3.7;\n  * intend to begin enrollment in a graduate program exactly **two Fall terms in the future**(not in the upcoming Fall term of the calendar year of application).\n\n\nThe Rhodes Scholarship constituencies determine age limits. Undergraduates aged 18 to 23 who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or DACA recipients may apply through the U.S. Rhodes constituency. Applicants up to age 26 who have graduated from their first undergraduate degree within the most recent academic year may be eligible for an exception to the age limit. Please review detailed eligibility information in the [Information for Candidates document](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/media/44850/information-for-candidates-usa.pdf).\nU.S. applicants must seek endorsement (nomination) from the campus through the Scholarship Opportunities Program.\nFor eligibility details for other Rhodes constituencies (non-U.S. citizens), please see the Information For Candidates document for [your country\u2019s constituency](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholarships/which-scholarship/).\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThe Rhodes Scholarship covers\n  * Oxford University (and College) fees;\n  * an annual stipend (in 2019-20, \u00a315,900 per annum/\u00a31,325 per month) from which Scholars pay all living expenses, including accommodation. Please note \u2013 this is not sufficient to cover partners or dependants.\n  * the fee for a Tier 4 study visa and the associated International Health Surcharge (IHS), which enables international students to access the UK\u2019s National Health Service;\n  * two economy class flights \u2013 to and from the UK \u2013 for the beginning and end of studies in Oxford;\n  * a settling-in allowance (\u00a3225 in 2019-20), upon arrival in Oxford.\n\n\nA number of research grants are also available to Rhodes Scholars, on application, which enable Scholars to, for example, attend international conferences or conduct additional fieldwork.\nAs Selection Committees select on the basis not only of intellect, but also of character, leadership, and commitment to service, [the Scholar Programme in Oxford](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholarships/life-at-oxford/) aims to build on these Rhodes Scholar qualities, with the first and second-year retreats, workshops, and conferences, in addition to social and discussion events, hosted at Rhodes House.\n### Recent Recipients and Finalists\nIn 2010, [Megan Braun](https://news.uci.edu/2020/01/28/ucis-impeachment-connection/) became UC Irvine\u2019s first Rhodes Scholar. Braun, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in history and minored in philosophy, studied international relations at Oxford University.\nToday\u2019s Rhodes Scholars include Presidents and Prime Ministers, but also medical researchers, social workers, teachers, and activists. Famous Rhodes Scholars include astronomer and inventor Edwin Hubble, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti, television news host Rachel Maddow, physician and author Siddhartha Mukherjee, and social entrepreneur Roxanne Joyal.\nWhatever the intended career path, recipients typically have outstanding academic and extracurricular records, are leaders in their university and (possibly) larger communities, show an inclination to serve others, and have a taste for sports, the arts, or other extracurricular activities that demonstrate passion, talent, and capacity for teamwork.\nOne Rhodes official describes successful candidates as having the potential \u201cto make things happen, to become public leaders 20 years from now.\u201d They should be \u201ca little scrappy,\u201d with \u201csome evidence of selflessness.\u201d They may or may not have brilliant academic records but will certainly have solid ones, enough to suggest that they \u201ccould do the work at Oxford\u201d while having sufficient time to make connections with peers and participate in Rhodes\u2019 unique leadership development program, which \u201cseeks to equip Scholars with the practical skills and tools to craft a life of purpose, meaning, and balance.\u201d\n### Competitiveness\nThe Rhodes Scholarship is highly competitive. In the 2016 U.S. constituency competition, 882 endorsed applications were reviewed for 32 scholarships.\nRhodes Selection Committees are looking for young people of outstanding intellect, character, leadership, and commitment to service.\nThe four criteria which governed the selection of Rhodes Scholars in 1902 are still the guiding criteria for the selection of Rhodes Scholars today:\n  * literary and scholastic attainments (academic excellence)\n  * energy to use one\u2019s talents to the full (as demonstrated by mastery in areas such as sports, music, debate, dance, theatre, and artistic pursuits, particularly where teamwork is involved)\n  * truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness, and fellowship\n  * moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one\u2019s fellow beings.\n\n\nBesides exceeding the 3.7 G.P.A. requirement, SOP recommends curating a record of original and significant accomplishment in your discipline (such as presentations, publications, exhibits, or performances), as well as a record of significant leadership achievement in campus or off-campus organizations, before applying to the Rhodes Scholarship. Most recent recipients of similar awards, like the Marshall Scholarship, participated in the [Campuswide Honors Collegium](http://honors.uci.edu/) and/or the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://www.urop.uci.edu/) and were also competitive for invitation to School-based Honors Programs.\n## Related Posts\n[Schwarzman Scholarship \\(Tsingua University, China\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\n##  [Schwarzman Scholarship (Tsingua University, China)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\nMay 25, 2022\nDesigned to prepare young leaders to deepen understanding between China and the rest of the world, Schwarzman Scholars is the first scholarship created to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st Century.

The Scholarship Committee looks for individuals with intellectual ability, scholastic achievement, and personal promise, as exhibited during the undergraduate years.\nSince 1975 the program has selected more than 640 college juniors from 110 different schools for support during graduate study at any accredited university.\n#### **Finances**\nEach scholar receives $4,000 prior to entering graduate school and an additional $30,000 while attending graduate school. There are no geographic restrictions on the use of the scholarship, and recipients are allowed to supplement the award with other scholarships, assistantships and research grants. The award may be spread over up to 5 years to comply with institutional limits on the total amount of a student\u2019s annual award and scholars must utilize all of the funding within five years of completion of undergraduate studies. In the absence of institutional support or limits, scholars may receive a maximum award of $15,000 annually.\n#### **For More Information**\nFurther information and applications are available at [the Beinecke website](http://fdnweb.org/beinecke/).\nFor applications and more information, contact the Scholarship Opportunities Program at 824-0189.

The program was set up at the request of Sir Winston Churchill in order to fulfil his vision of US\u2013UK scientific exchange with the goal of advancing science and technology on both sides of the Atlantic, helping to ensure our future prosperity and security.\nMany Churchill Scholars describe their year in Cambridge as the best year of their lives since it allows scholars to form friendships with their future colleagues from around the world, to attend the only college at Cambridge that is focused on STEM subjects, and have an opportunity for independent research (often leading to publications) that Churchill Scholars will not find again until well into their PhD programs.\n### Fields of Study\n**_Eligibility by UCI School: Biological Sciences, Engineering, Information & Computer Science, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Public Health (Science only)._**\nApplicants must intend to enroll in a research-based master\u2019s degree program in an eligible STEM Field of Study at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom. Please see [Programs of Study](https://www.churchillscholarship.org/the-scholarship#Programs-of-Study-1) on the Churchill website for the current list of eligible master\u2019s programs. The Scholarship is only for a 1-year Master\u2019s degree, so your application must be for an MPhil or MASt, or in rare cases an MRes. \n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for SOP advising services on a Churchill application, an undergraduate student (or recent undergraduate alumni) must:\n  * be a junior (intending to graduate next academic year), a graduating senior (intending to graduate in the current academic year) or a recent graduate who earned an undergraduate (B.S.) degree from UCI within the past 12 months;\n  * be a U.S. citizen;\n  * intend to begin enrollment in a graduate program exactly **two Fall terms in the future**(not in the upcoming Fall term of the calendar year of application);\n  * have never previously enrolled in, nor earned, a doctoral degree in any field.\n\n\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThe Churchill Scholarship is worth around $60,000, depending on the exchange rate, including:\n  * all University and College fees (currently about $40,000);\n  * a living allowance, which in 2018-19 is \u00a311,083 if enrolled in a nine-month program, \u00a313,447 if enrolled in an eleven-month program, and \u00a314,777 if enrolled in a full-year program;\n  * an allowance of up to $1,500 for travel to and from the United Kingdom, as well as reimbursement of applications fees for a UK visa and health surcharge (currently over $500);\n  * and the possibility of a Special Research Grant of up to $2,000. This grant may cover travel for presentations at international conferences, short stays at another university or institute for special research, and other activities.\n\n\n### Competitiveness\nThe UCI Churchill committee will interview candidates to determine whether their applications have earned campus endorsement (nomination). UCI may endorse up to two candidates whom the Committee feels have the potential to be Churchill Scholars.\nEndorsed applications for the Churchill Scholarship are submitted to the Winston Churchill Foundation of the United States and reviewed by a Selection Committee comprised of at least eight former Churchill Scholars from a variety of STEM disciplines. In 2020, the committee reviewed 120 nominated applications for the 15 scholarships.\nThe three official selection criteria are:\n**Outstanding academic achievement.** There is no minimum GPA, though most applicants have a very high average. The Committee looks at achievement in STEM courses, especially in the major, as indicated by course grades and recommendation letters.\n**Proven talent in research.** Applicants in the sciences and engineering will demonstrate extensive laboratory experience, internships, or other related work, while applicants in mathematics will show substantial independent work or other projects. The Committee looks for originality and creativity.\n**Outstanding personal qualities.** Understanding the time commitment required by research, the Churchill Foundation does not seek so-called \u201cwell-rounded\u201d applicants; instead, it seeks applicants with what we call interesting \u201cjagged edges.\u201d The Committee takes into account interests and achievements outside of research, but it does not favor any particular kind of activity.\nNearly all Churchill Scholars in recent years have previously received the **Goldwater Scholarship for Excellence in Research** (please see U.S. Awards page). Moreover, recent recipients have had a 3.9+ GPA, two or more years of research experience, and demonstrated professional competence and dedication to the field of study through peer-reviewed journal publications, regional or national conference presentations, leadership or mentoring roles in academic or science-related organizations, and/or significant work experience or internships related to the major.\n## Related Posts\n[Schwarzman Scholarship \\(Tsingua University, China\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\n##  [Schwarzman Scholarship (Tsingua University, China)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\nMay 25, 2022\nDesigned to prepare young leaders to deepen understanding between China and the rest of the world, Schwarzman Scholars is the first scholarship created to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st Century.

Prospective scholars must have demonstrated a record of intellectual distinction, leadership, and extracurricular activity, as well as personal characteristics of honesty, integrity, fairness, and unselfish service to others that indicates a potential future for leadership and contribution to society.

    "content": "# Fulbright US Student Study/Research Program (140+ host countries)\n### About\nThe [Fulbright U.S. Student Program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) is the largest U.S. exchange program offering opportunities for recent graduates and young professionals to undertake international graduate study, advanced research, university teaching, and primary and secondary school teaching worldwide. The program currently awards approximately 2,000 grants annually in all fields of study and operates in more than 140 countries worldwide.\nApplicants for Study/Research awards design their own academic projects and will typically work with advisers at foreign universities or other institutes of higher education. Study/Research supports one academic year (approximately 10 months) of specialized study, independent research, or a creative arts project. Your Study/Research Statement of Grant Purpose (project proposal essay) may include plans to undertake coursework, either as a non-degree student or as a first-year enrolled graduate student at a university in the host country. It will also likely include plans to respond to specific, clearly stated questions or knowledge gaps in your field of study by completing a well-defined and feasible academic or artistic project, similar to a thesis.\nIf your primary interest is in gaining hands-on work experience abroad, there are two alternative types of Fulbright U.S. Student Program grant which you might consider \u2014 the [English Teaching Assistantship program](https://scholars.uci.edu/scholarships/postgraduate-internships/#fullbright-english-teaching-assistantship), and the [Binational Business Internship](https://scholars.uci.edu/scholarships/postgraduate-internships/#fullbright-binational-business-internship), detailed on our [Postgraduate Internships](https://scholars.uci.edu/scholarships/postgraduate-internships) page.\nDuring their grants, Fulbrighters will meet, work, live with and learn from the people of the host country, sharing daily experiences. The program facilitates cultural exchange through direct interaction on an individual basis in the classroom, field, home, and in routine tasks, allowing the grantee to gain an appreciation of others\u2019 viewpoints and beliefs, the way they do things, and the way they think. Through engagement in the community, the individual will interact with their hosts on a one-to-one basis in an atmosphere of openness, academic integrity, and intellectual freedom, thereby promoting mutual understanding.\n### Placement Types\nPlacements are available in approximately 140 host countries in multiple world regions: East Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, South and Central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Western Hemisphere.\nUnless otherwise stated in the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries), Study/Research candidates are required to affiliate (seek a formal mentoring relationship) with an academic or artistic mentor at a university or other organization (such as a research, cultural, or other nonprofit organization). Candidates who intend to perform academic research or conduct a creative arts project will need to identify at least one discipline-specific mentor with appropriate expertise. As part of the application process, you will be required to research such disciplinary experts in the host country in order to make contact with them independently. SOP staff provide strategic guidance and tips on establishing first contact with potential affiliates, but we do not maintain a list of potential affiliates or arrange affiliations on behalf of candidates. You will need to continue your dialogue with your affiliate over the summer to ensure that your affiliate has opportunities to offer significant input on the design of your Study/Research project proposal.\nCandidates who plan to take coursework in the host country must affiliate with a university and satisfy any university-specific and academic department-specific requirements for graduate program admissions or non-degree course enrollment. You will work independently to research the available universities and correspond with their staff on any additional application materials that the university or department may require you to submit.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Fulbright U.S. Student Program places no limitations on your major or field of study. However, some countries give preference to majors in specific fields of study. Consult the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries) to see whether there are stated preferences.\nStudy/Research grants require three letters of recommendation from individuals (especially professors or research mentors) who can confirm your strengths in your proposed field of study or research.\n### Eligibility\nTo apply for the Fulbright U.S. Student Program through the SOP advising process, applicants must:\n  * Be undergraduate juniors (graduating next academic year), graduating seniors (graduating this academic year), or recent alumni (within 12 months of graduation).\n  * Be citizens or nationals of the United States of America at the time of application. Permanent residents are not eligible.\n  * Complete your undergraduate degree before travel (often, but not always, by the end of Summer Session I). Consult the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries) for the program start date.\n  * Meet the language requirements of the award to which they are applying, demonstrated by submitting a Foreign Language Evaluation. Consult the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries) for the language proficiency requirements.\n  * Demonstrate sufficient competency to complete their project and adjust to life in the host country.\n\n\nFor most programs, applicants who have had extensive, recent previous foreign experience in the host country are at a competitive disadvantage but are still eligible to apply. In some cases it may not be feasible for a dual national to participate in a Fulbright program in the country of his or her other nationality due to host country law or policy. However, enrollment in a formal study abroad program as an undergraduate will not be considered a disadvantage. Please see [Eligibility](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/eligibility), including the Ineligibility section, for details.\nThose who have lived or worked abroad (outside of formal study abroad programs) are encouraged to apply to a host country where they have not yet lived. Since Fulbright is an international exchange program, apply to a country where you would not yet be considered \u201ca cultural insider.\u201d\nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that Study/Research applicants achieve at least a 3.5 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of experience related to the selected grant type and proposed project. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of research or creative and performing arts experience; evidence of exceptional achievements related to your course of study, such as publications, presentations, performances, exhibits, etc.; leadership roles in academic, extracurricular, or service organizations; and related work experience/internships.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nTotal value of the award varies by country. Grant benefits for all Fulbright U.S. Student grants include:\n  * round-trip transportation to the host country\n  * funding to cover room, board, and incidental costs, based on the cost of living in the host country\n  * Accident & Sickness Health Benefits\n  * 24/7 support line for urgent and non-urgent situations\n  * 12 months of non-competitive eligibility (NCE) hiring status within the federal government\n\n\nIn some countries, grants may also include:\n  * book and research allowances*\n  * mid-term enrichment activities\n  * full or partial tuition\n  * language study programs\n  * pre-departure and in-country orientations\n\n\nSpecific information concerning finances for each country is described in the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/regions) and/or posted on the local Fulbright Commission website.\n### Recent Recipients, Finalists, & Semi-Finalists\nAs of 2020, UCI has had 68 undergraduate and recent alumni Fulbright U.S. Student Program grant recipients. Read about recent recipients and semi-finalists on our [Recipients](https://scholars.uci.edu/scholarship-recipients/) page.\n  * In 2020, [Aditi Mayer](https://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/calendar/story_details.php?recid=2117) (Literary Journalism, International Studies) received a Study/Research Grant to India and also became the first UCI recipient of the supplemental National Geographic Digital Storytelling Fellowship.\n  * In 2018, [Madeline Collins](https://www.humanities.uci.edu/eastasian/user_files/2017-2018_Newletter.pdf) (Korean Language and Culture) received a Study/Research grant to South Korea to support master\u2019s level study at Yonsei University.

They also confer special status on winners during their year of foreign study, as outstanding, officially recognized representatives of their country. Famous Fulbright recipients include Thomas Pickering, John Lithgow, and Renee Fleming. At least 47 UCI faculty have also received Fulbright grants.\n### Competitiveness\nApproximately 950 Study/Research applicants receive a grant each year. Competitiveness varies significantly from host country to host country. Your odds of receiving a Study/Research grant are improved by applying to countries with [comparatively low ratios of applicants to slots](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/statistics); in particular, consider destinations other than the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.\n_UCI graduate students: As our office supports undergraduates, please contact the_[ _Graduate & Postdoctoral Scholar Resource Center_](https://www.grad.uci.edu/funding/index.php) _for graduate fellowship advising services._\n_UCI faculty: As our office supports undergraduates, we are not able to provide advising to_[ _Fulbright Scholar Program_](https://www.cies.org/) _applicants.

Founders envisioned a UK scholarship program for American students that would affirm the long-term value of Anglo-American relations and strengthen its close association with the US.\nStudents can apply to study at a British university for a One Year Marshall Scholarship, which cannot be extended beyond one academic year, or a Two year Marshall Scholarship, which is tenable for two academic years but may be extended through the end of a third academic year.\nYou must determine your first and second choice graduate programs for each year of the Marshall funding. Undertake thorough research to familiarize yourself with the top programs in your field in the U.K.\n**Eligibility**  \nOnly U.S. citizens with a minimum G.P.A. of 3.7 are eligible to apply. Begin the process during the spring before your final year on campus by submitting a [Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/). Current seniors or recent UCI alumni may also apply. You must finish your bachelor\u2019s degree before enrollment. However, you do NOT need to have earned a bachelor\u2019s degree by the time you apply.\nApplicants should demonstrate professional competence and dedication to the field of study through leadership or mentoring roles in academic or service organizations, publications or performances, and/or significant work experience/internships related to the major.\nPlease note that external scholarship agencies will consider all of your credit-bearing coursework from any college or institution as part of the review process (including CSU, community colleges, private colleges or other UC campuses/Extension programs, and including units earned while in high school). Grades from other colleges will be included in calculation of your overall GPA for eligibility purposes.\nUCI graduate students: contact the [Graduate Resource Center](https://www.grad.uci.edu/services/grc/index.php) for advising.\n**Degrees Funded  \n**\nThe Marshall Scholarship funds study at any British university in any discipline at the graduate level, leading to the award of a British university degree. However, there are caveats and restrictions. The Marshall Scholarship does not fund second bachelor\u2019s degrees, MBAs, or degrees \u201cleading to professional qualifications in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science and law.\u201d For a more detailed breakdown of courses ineligible for Marshall funding, click [here](http://www.marshallscholarship.org/applications/apply).\n**Application Process  \n**\nWorking with SOP advisors is mandatory, as campus nomination is required. To begin the SOP advising process, juniors, graduating seniors, and alumni within 1 year of graduation complete a [Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/). In April and May, SOP staff review Pre-Applications and meet with potential applicants to discuss their candidacy and subsequent steps. For detailed information about each stage of the application process \u2014 including the roles of campus endorsement and evaluation \u2014 please view the Application Process Overview.\nAfter completing the Pre-App and meeting with SOP staff to discuss your candidacy, you will work on drafts of your application and receive strategic coaching from SOP staff. As time permits, SOP staff may also offer advising to your recommendation letter writers. For detailed information about each stage of the application process, please view the Application Process Overview\nNext, you will begin work on the formal application. Your supporting documents will include application forms, to be drafted within the application system, in addition to four essays and one short answer. These written responses include: a 1000-word personal statement describing your intellectual development and interests; a 500-word essay describing your proposed academic program and rationale for your choice of program and university; a 500-sord essay describing a situation in which you recognized and responded to a need for leadership; a 500-word essay regarding your ambassadorial potential and describing what the \u201cUSA-UK special relationship means\u201d; and a 300-word short answer describing your post-scholarship plans.\nSupporting documents for your application will also letters of recommendation, which will be due during the summer. Marshall requires four letters of recommendation, three of which must be written by U.S. faculty. The fourth letter of recommendation should comment on your leadership experience and potential. In addition, you must secure letters of affiliation for your first-choice graduate program(s) in order to obtain campus endorsement; letters for second-choice program(s) are recommended.\nThe UCI Marshall committee will interview candidates to determine whether their applications have earned campus endorsement (nomination). The University will endorse candidates whom the Committee feels have the potential to be Marshall Scholars and will offer feedback for refining the application before submission for funding consideration. The SOP will write comprehensive nomination letters for each endorsed candidate, to be included in your final application materials.\nThe U.S. is divided into eight regions; candidates apply in either the region in which they are legally a resident or the one in which they attend school.

    "content": "# Gates Cambridge Scholarship (Cambridge University, United Kingdom)\n### About\nThe [Gates Cambridge Scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/) programme was established in October 2000 by a donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the University of Cambridge. The Gates Cambridge mission is to build a global network of future leaders committed to improving the lives of others. It aims to achieve this mission by selecting outstanding scholars, providing them with financial and non-financial support at one of the world\u2019s leading universities and facilitating community building at and beyond Cambridge.\n### Fields of Study\nEach year Gates Cambridge offers approximately 80 full-cost scholarships to outstanding applicants from countries outside the UK to pursue a full-time, residential postgraduate degree (Ph.D., MSc, MLitt, MPhil, or other one-year postgraduate course) in any subject available at the University of Cambridge.\nIneligible programs: Gates does not fund any undergraduate degrees, part-time degrees, or non-degree courses, nor will it fund MBA, MFin, PGCE, MBBChir Clinical Studies, MD, or Graduate Course in Medicine degrees.\nAll graduate students become a member of one of Cambridge\u2019s 31 Colleges, each with its own character and offerings. The College system is unique to Cambridge and Oxford and offers an enhanced experience where students and academics from across disciplines meet, discuss, and form bonds. Throughout its history, Cambridge has had Colleges, which are intimate social and intellectual communities of scholars. They are educational charities, each with a particular mission and character, and they have evolved in response to different social pressures. They remain flexible, reacting to the changing needs of their members. But all are devoted to study and research across the range of disciplines and generations.\nGoverned by Fellows, who are mostly academics employed in the University, the Colleges remain integral to the University\u2019s educational and research environment today. They can offer you a home and other facilities that universities usually provide centrally. They also give you experiences and opportunities that are unique to Cambridge. More information about the College system is on the [Cambridge Postgraduate website](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/colleges).\n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for SOP advising services on a Gates Cambridge application, an undergraduate student (or recent undergraduate alumni) must:\n  * be a junior (intending to graduate next academic year), a graduating senior (intending to graduate in the current academic year) or a recent undergraduate degree recipient from UCI within the past 12 months;\n  * a citizen of any country outside the United Kingdom;\n  * intend to begin enrollment in a graduate program exactly **two Fall terms in the future**(not in the upcoming Fall term of the calendar year of application);\n  * have never previously enrolled in, nor earned, a doctoral degree in any field.\n\n\n### Scholarship Benefits\nA Gates Cambridge Scholarship covers the full cost of studying at Cambridge, including:\n  * the University Composition Fee at the appropriate rate;\n  * a maintenance allowance for a single student (\u00a317,500 for 12 months at the 2020-21 rate; pro rata for courses shorter than 12 months) \u2013 for PhD scholars the award is for up to 4 years;\n  * one economy single airfare at both the beginning and end of the course;\n  * inbound visa costs & the cost of the Immigration Health Surcharge.\n\n\nScholars may also apply for additional funding on a discretionary basis:\n  * Academic development funding \u2013 from up to \u00a3500 to up to \u00a32,000, dependent on the length of your course, to attend conferences and courses;\n  * Family allowance \u2013 up to \u00a310,120 for a first child and up to \u00a34,320 for a second child (2020-21 rate). No funding is provided for a partner;\n  * Fieldwork \u2013 you may apply to keep up to your normal maintenance allowance while on fieldwork as part of your PhD (the Trust does not fund other fieldwork costs as these should be funded by the University Composition Fee);\n  * Maternity/Paternity funding \u2013 should you require it, you may apply to intermit your studies for up to 6 months and continue to receive your maintenance allowance during this time;\n  * Hardship funding \u2013 for unforeseen difficulties.\n\n\nMost costs are covered by the Scholarship, but Gates Cambridge does not cover bench fees or the costs of scientific equipment or similar academic resources. The Trust expects such core course costs to be covered by the academic department at Cambridge.\nThere are numerous community-building events throughout the year, including orientation for new Scholars, a welcome dinner, professional development events run by the Learning for Purpose programme, an annual lecture, Day of Service, Day of Research, Gala, Scholar symposia, and a Graduation Dinner \u2013 in addition to regular informal activities each week. The Scholars\u2019 Council hosts many of these events and facilitates Scholars in hosting their own events. Scholars have access to the well-resourced Scholars\u2019 Room \u2013 a physical hub for many Gates Cambridge activities.\nWhether or not you are eligible for a Gates Cambridge Scholarship, you may be eligible for other funding offered by the University of Cambridge.

If interested, please visit[Events](http://scholars.uci.edu/events/) to sign-up._**\n**Overview**  \nSchwarzman Scholars is a fully-funded master\u2019s program in Global Affairs leadership at Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of China\u2019s most prestigious universities. The program aims to cultivate the next generation of international leaders through fostering a better understanding of China\u2019s role in global trends. In addition to the core coursework, students choose from concentrations in Public Policy, Economics and Business, or International Studies, and complete corporate or non-profit internships for real-world leadership experience.

You must finish your bachelor\u2019s degree before enrollment in the Schwarzman Scholars program. However, you do NOT need to have earned a bachelor\u2019s degree by the time you apply.\nPlease note that external scholarship agencies will consider all of your credit-bearing coursework from any college or institution as part of the review process (including CSU, community colleges, private colleges or other UC campuses/Extension programs, and including units earned while in high school). Grades from other colleges will be included in calculation of your overall GPA for eligibility purposes.\nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that applicants achieve at least a 3.7 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of noteworthy accomplishment, professional competence, and dedication to ambitious career goals in public service, international business or trade, or academia. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of leadership or mentoring roles in academic, extracurricular, or service organizations; publications or performances; and/or significant work experience/internships relevant to the stated career goals.\nUp to 200 Schwarzman Scholars will be funded every year, with about 45% of the awards going to students from the United States.\n**SOP Optional Advising Process**  \nCampus endorsement (nomination) is not a component of the Schwarzman Scholars application.

In 2016-17, Cassie Zhang was named an Alternate (waitlisted), and Stella Liu became a Schwarzman semi-finalist.\nSelection will be based on academic excellence and leadership potential as well as performance in the semi-finalist interviews.

    "content": "# Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)\n2nd entry: On February 12, 2010, I witnessed the first snowfall to blanket Rome since February 1986 (oddly enough, exactly two weeks before I was born). The city was in an uproar: banks closed, traffic was at a standstill, children ran from their classrooms to throw snowballs, and in spite of the icy cobblestones, people flocked to the Vatican to catch a rare glimpse of the Piazza San Pietro covered in white.\nAnd the weekend only got more memorable. [](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/files/2010/04/Mario-Luigi-at-Carnevale-in-Venice.jpg)\nThe following day I hopped on a train from Rome to Venice, where an entirely different sort of uproar had taken over the city: Carnevale! With several friends I spent an entire day and night wandering the streets of Venice  _in maschera_. The crowds were packed with people in lavish costumes\u2014among the traditional Venetian masks and gowns we spotted everything from the Ghostbusters to God to the Mario Brothers. It was incredible to see how much work and creativity was poured into creating these costumes! When night fell Piazza San Marco and the Rialto exploded with live music and dancing. This happened to be my second trip to Venice, but only after this experience did I truly understand the city\u2019s wonder and charm.\n[](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/files/2010/04/Carnevale-di-Ivrea.jpg)After experiencing Venice\u2019s Carnevale, I decided that I wanted to witness a lesser-known Carnevale for comparison. My curiosity led me to Ivrea, a small town just outside of Torino in Northern Italy. Ivrea celebrates Carnevale with \u201cLa Battaglia delle Arance\u201d (the Battle of the Oranges). You won\u2019t believe it until you see it. This battle, representing an uprising of Ivrea\u2019s peasants against their tyrannical overlords in the Middle Ages, takes over the entire town. People on the ground are members of 9 different teams (my personal favorite being named the \u201cOrange Throwers of Death\u201d); these teams \u2018fight\u2019 against some two-dozen horse-drawn chariots that ride through the crowded piazzas. What ensues is that the people on the ground, pockets filled to the brim, throw orange after orange at the chariot riders, and vice versa. By the end of the day, I saw many broken noses and fat lips\u2014and the ground was one thick pulpy mess!\nMy research in Art History involves a great deal of reading and translating, analyzing drawings and paintings, and spending many hours in libraries throughout Rome. But I feel as though I\u2019m learning the most from participating in local traditions such as these, which are history in the making.

A graduate of the UCLA ROTC program, she commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in 2005 as well but delayed her military service one year so she could study for her M.A. in International Security and Conflict Studies at Dublin City University as a George J. Mitchell scholar. Following her year in Ireland, Brittany returned to the U.S. for a year of training as an intelligence analyst in the Air Force; she subsequently used those skills in an eight year Air Force career, with postings in Korea and Belgium, as well as deployments to Afghanistan and Africa. In 2014, Brittany joined the Foreign Service and has been posted to Haiti and Brunei. Along with her husband and daughter, Brittany is currently serving as the Deputy Political, Economic and Consular Chief at the U.S. Embassy in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, where she works on an array of issues, including human rights, religious freedom, and international trade.\n********************************************************\n****_Brittany Schick, UCI\u2019s first Mitchell Scholarship winner, received her bachelor\u2019s degrees from UCI in Political Science and International Studies in 2005. She pursued a Master\u2019s degree in International Security and Conflict Studies at Dublin City University through the Mitchell. Her long-term goal was and has been to work in the intelligence community._\n_The US-Ireland Alliance is a non-partisan, non-profit organization dedicated to consolidating existing relations between the United States and Ireland. Brittany knew she wanted to study for her Master\u2019s overseas and she was really interested in using the N. Ireland conflict as a model for other conflicts in the world, so this was a major factor in pursuing the Mitchell and Ireland._\n_\u201cMitchell scholars leave a footprint and have a lifelong impact on Ireland, \u201cstates Schick._\n_\u201cHaving an understanding of the culture and the history of conflict there has been helpful for my work, not only in my work with other Europeans in organizations like NATO, but also in my work now as a diplomat.\u201d_\n_How did the Mitchell opportunity prepare you to make an impact, not only in Ireland, but in the world and in your own career path?_\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-Prior-to-Graduating-from-UCI.jpg)\nBrittany Prior to Graduating from UCI\n_\u201cAcademically, I think being part of a security and conflict program that was so multi-national, i.e. included the perspectives of many diverse nations, has been really helpful in my work with NATO and now as a diplomat. Personally, I really must credit the Mitchell with providing some of my closest friendships and professional contacts, which is of course a huge part of daily lives and cannot be underestimated.\u201d_\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-during-the-Mitchell-year-with-all-of-the-other-female-Mitchell-Scholars-2005.jpg)\nDuring my Mitchell Year, with all the other female Mitchell Scholars, 2005\n**You****have been the only Mitchell recipient at UCI. What was your major at UCI and how did learn about the Mitchell? What inspired you to apply?**\nI was majoring in political science and international studies with a focus on Western Europe. I was part of the Campuswide Honors Program and they had a program to help students apply for prestigious scholarships, like the Fulbright, the Truman and so forth. I actually applied for a few of them, but the Mitchell is the one I received and in retrospect it really was the best fit for me. I was working with Audrey DeVore and Rebecca Harris back when they worked there in the Campuswide Honors office.\n**Why the Mitchell? Why study in Ireland?**\nI was focusing on Western Europe in my studies and the summer between my junior and senior year I was part of a [study abroad program](http://www.cie.uci.edu/index.shtml), the first cohort to go do an exchange with the [University of Lund in Sweden.](http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/) And now, more than 10 years later, that exchange continues. Students from all the UCs went to the University of Lund; we took classes with Lund students and we had both UC professors and University of Lund professors. It was different from most international exchanges because the focus was more on politics, rather than on language or culture.. Our focus was mostly on the politics of Europe and the European Union. During the program we took a trip to Brussels and, among other places, got to visit EU headquarters and NATO headquarters.\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-at-NATO.jpg)\nBrittany at NATO\nWe also went to Stockholm and met with members of the Swedish government. So, it was a really interesting program and was the first time that I got to spend a significant amount of time in Europe, which helped solidify my desire to come back and do my Masters in Europe. So this experience led me to apply for the Fulbright in the UK, as well as the Mitchell to study in Ireland or Northern Ireland and it ended up working out for the Mitchell.\n**How did you sell your point in your personal statement? What do you think made you stand out?**\nThe program was still relatively young. 2001 was the first graduating class of Mitchells.\nThe U.S.-Ireland alliance administers the Mitchell program, which allows American leaders to pursue a year of graduate study in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The goal is to provide future leaders with an understanding and interest in Ireland. The Alliance was created by Trina Vargo in 1998. She had worked with Senator Mitchell to create a program that would deepen that U.S.-Ireland alliance. So, basically, the scholarship was the main place holder in that alliance.\nBeing a young program back when I was applying in 2005 (2001 was the first graduating class of Mitchells), they hadn\u2019t had a lot of candidates with military background, service academy experience, or anyone who was part of an ROTC program.\nI was one of the first females accepted into the program who was also pursuing a future in the military. I think my ambition to combine my academic study with a military career, specifically serving overseas within the intelligence field, was part of what made me a relatively unique candidate for the scholarship.\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Meeting-Senator-Mitchell-with-some-of-the-other-Scholars-while-in-N-Ireland-2006.jpg)\nMeeting Senator Mitchell with some of the Scholars while in N Ireland, 2006\n**Tell me about your military background and UCI? What came first?**\nDuring my four years at UCI, I was also a cadet in the Air Force reserve officer training corps (ROTC) program up at UCLA. ROTC is basically, one of three ways someone can earn a commission and become an officer in the U.S. military. So when I graduated from college, I commissioned the same week, became an officer, and was granted an administrative delay from the Air Force, which essentially allowed me to take advantage of the Mitchell scholarship.\nI served in the Air Force for eight year after graduate school and am currently in the inactive ready reserves, which means I maintain my commission as an officer but am not actively serving in the military.\n**How did you juggle ROTC duties with UCI demands?**\nIt was really hard. That\u2019s the reason that I got a \u201cC\u201d in honors micro-bio. I remember I was in the [Campuswide Honors Program](http://honors.uci.edu/) and had to do ROTC every Friday, so I was gone from Irvine and forced to miss classes every Friday. I was lucky enough that I was able to schedule most of my classes Tuesday/Thursdays or Mondays and Wednesdays, but there was this one required micro-bio class that was M/W/F and I found it impossible, having missed 1/3 of the classes, to do well.\n**UCI is so intensive. It almost requires a full-time commitment to the space.**\nYes, it definitely does. Being first to register for classes because of being in the **CHP program** gave me that edge to accommodate a crazy schedule. It was hard. I double-majored, and technically, could have triple-majored because I was taking classes up at UCLA, like Aerospace studies, history and classes that were specific to ROTC affairs. I ended up graduating with so many units that it was enough for a triple-major.\nIt would suffice to say that through my college years, I didn\u2019t work during the school year; there just wasn\u2019t enough time.\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-Traveling-with-the-SACEUR-while-posted-to-SHAPE-in-Europe-2010.jpg)\nBrittany Traveling with the SACEUR while posted to SHAPE in Europe, 2010\n**What ended up being your double-majors at UCI?**\nPolitical Science and International studies.\nI didn\u2019t get a degree from UCLA, I just completed my ROTC requirements there. ROTC detachments are located all over the United States and allow cadets to come to that university, even if they\u2019re not a full-time student there, just to fulfill their ROTC obligations in order to earn their commission, which means taking military studies classes and otherwise participating in the ROTC program. The degree, at UCLA, in my case, was getting a commission in the United States Airforce and becoming an officer upon graduation.\nAnd, since I get this question a lot, in order to an officer in the U.S. military, yes, you must have a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-Deployed-to-Afghanistan-2012.jpg)\nBrittany-Deployed to Afghanistan, 2012\n**Why did you choose UCI?**\nI grew up outside Chicago and when I started looking at universities I was drawn to ones far away from home. I think, like a lot of teenagers, I wanted to have a different experience. My aunt and uncle lived in Yorba Linda and we used to come out on vacation, so I knew I loved the area. I knew that the University of California was the #1 public school system in the country, so I went out there and looked at a few of the UCs in that area. I remember coming onto the Irvine campus and walking out to Aldrich Park and it was so calm and peaceful that I just knew I\u2019d be at home there.\n**Once UCI endorsed you for the Mitchell, where did you go for the interview?**\nI went to Washington DC.\n**Tell me a little bit about that process**. **What kind of questions did they ask you?**\nBack then, they were still doing semi-finalist interviews in person. I understand they have now changed that. So I flew out for that. A couple of days later, I found out that I was going to be a finalist and then I had to fly out a week later for the final interview. Literally the day after the final interview I found out that I had received the scholarship.\nThe semi-finalist interview was just an interview. There were just two people I met with. When I did the finalist interview, the whole process started the night before the actual interview. There is a reception, usually at the Irish Embassy in Washington D.C,. And you are there with all of the other finalists and with the people who will be part of your panel the next day, but you don\u2019t know who they are.\nIt\u2019s all part of the process. The Irish Ambassador is usually there, so it\u2019s formal but not an intimidating event. The Mitchell interview process is meant to be an opportunity to let you talk in a more natural atmosphere and see if you are the type of person who can handle this type of situation because they look at you as essentially being an ambassador of the U.S. abroad.\nThe next day they do the finalist interviews. They had a panel of interviewers, about 9 to 12 people on the panel; it was a huge panel. You walk in and you are like, \u201cWow! This is a lot of people.\u201d But it\u2019s not an aggressive interview. They are not trying to trip you up. You still need to know your stuff. Everyone takes turns asking you questions. It\u2019s a thorough interview, but it is also fast-paced, about 20 minutes.\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-Engagment-photo-in-Seoul-fall-2013.jpg)\nBrittany-Engagement Photo in Seoul\n**What do you mean by, they will expect you to know your stuff?**\nThey will ask you questions about your experiences and details in your application. They will ask you, why the Mitchell? Why Ireland? To get to this point in the application process you need to have identified the what, why and where in Ireland. They will ask you about that.\nThe reason for these specific questions is that lots of people will want to say that they got this prestigious scholarship, but the question for the committee is, has this applicant _really_ thought it through? Interviewers are trying to gauge whether the candidate is really interested in the U.S.-Ireland relationship or just looking for opportunities to study abroad.\nAre you just chasing the accolade, or do you have a really good reason for why you want to pursue this specific opportunity?\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-Hiking-in-Haiti-with-my-daughter-on-my-back-winter-2015-Medium.jpg)\nBrittany-Hiking in Haiti with my daughter on my back, winter 2015\n**What did you tell them?**\nI was interested in the Northern Ireland conflict; specifically, how they resolved that conflict. I ended up doing my dissertation on a comparison between the IRA in Northern Ireland and Hamas in the Palestinian Territories and Israel. I was interested in comparing how the populations supporting both of those groups influenced their tactics.\n**It sounds like you wowed them with your knowledge of the political climate and the contemporary issues.**\nI think they appreciated that I had done my research on Ireland and why I wanted to study there. Also, generally speaking, they appreciate candidates who are well-rounded. They are not just looking for a 4.0 GPA and candidates who just have a stellar academic record. They want you to have community service, and leadership experience, and a certain type of personality \u2013 someone who can speak comfortably and be articulate. Not just someone who is book-smart. I believe they would be willing to accept a 3.5 or 3.6 GPA if a candidate had the other qualities.\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2017/06/Brittany-Giving-a-radio-interview-while-posted-to-Haiti-as-a-Foreign-Service-Officer-2015.jpg)\nBrittany-Giving a radio interview while posted to Haiti as a Foreign Service Officer, 2015\n**What was your experience like when you got to Ireland? What was a day in your life like?**\nOnce the Mitchells are awarded, the program can send up to two Mitchell\u2019s to any university in Ireland. You could have Mitchells in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. Generally they\u2019ll have two students at each of the best known universities, like Queens in Belfast and Trinity in Dublin. But there are universities all over the island. I went to Dublin City University (DCU), which is about 20 minutes north of Dublin. Depending on where you go, you will have a different experience. You\u2019ll be in a different city, a different campus and naturally you are going to study different subjects, but you have an opportunity to influence all that in your application.\nI was fortunate. The year I got there was the first year they had a program in International Security and Conflict Studies. When I interviewed I was going to go into a general IR program because that\u2019s all the country had. But when I found out they\u2019d be adding the security/conflict degree I asked for permission to go into that instead and they approved it.\nDCU ended up attracting students from all over the world for this particular program and it was wonderful. There was one student from Nigeria; there were a couple other classmates from the United States; there was a classmate from Spain. I thought it was a great program because you didn\u2019t just have the Irish perspective. When you talk about a topic like international conflict it is always great to have people from several perspectives and different continents share their views. I\u2019m actually still friends with one of the great Irish girls who was in the same program.\nThe most enduring relationships that I created were with my fellow Mitchells. Several of us have stayed in touch. We\u2019ve gone on vacations together, our kids play together, one of them was even in our wedding party! . In fact, I\u2019m going over to one of their homes for brunch tomorrow! More than 10 years later, we are still very close.\nThis was really the best period of my life for developing genuine relationships with truly kind people who also have great careers and are really going somewhere. It was never networking in the sense of using one another to claw your way to the top. It was more like drinking beer together, talking about our classes, and catching up. We traveled all over Europe together and beyond. We had all these great, organic experiences together. And over time, since graduation, that has developed into a network of great friends who I call for everything from parenting advice to help prepping for an important interview. Most of them have gone on to get additional advanced degrees from some very prestigious universities like Yale and Harvard. They\u2019ve lived all over: Timor Leste, Germany, Sri Lanka\u2026 They\u2019ve traveled to some incredible places, and they\u2019re doing everything from groundbreaking research to fighting to reduce poverty.\n**Given that you are our only recipient at Uci so far, where do you suggest that we recruit students who might be a great fit?**\nThe great thing about the Mitchell, unlike many other programs, is that they take people from any field of study. You can have a dancer or a musician. We even had a guy in our class who was a firefighter. If they can articulate why they want to study in Ireland, any major is eligible for this program. It\u2019s not just political science or international studies. I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019s ranked now, but I know when I went to UCI the dance program was 2nd in the nation and I\u2019d be surprised if students in the fine arts realize that opportunities like the Mitchell are available to them. I would say you can also definitely recruit through the campuswide honors program because you\u2019ll find students there with strong academic backgrounds, which of course is a must for a scholarship like this. Students who are strong academically, diverse, articulate, well-rounded and leaders will be solid candidates.\nIn the application there is a space for the candidate to identify the top three universities and programs they\u2019re interested in. It would be good for applicants to do their research on both because if theyget to the interview point, they\u2019ll need to be able to articulate that.\n**In looking up your biography, you\u2019ve lived in Haiti and Korea. Can you tell me about that?**\nCurrently, I am a Foreign Service officer with the State Department. I lived in Haiti for two years where I worked as a Counselor Officer. I worked in the immigrant, and non-immigrant visa units, as well as American Citizen Services. I interviewed applicants for visas, whether it was for leisure, business, or study. I also conducted interviews for those who were in the process of legally immigrating to the United States.Working in American Citizen Services was a bit different \u2013 probably the most interesting part of the job! It wasn\u2019t just helping Americans who had lost their passport, it was everything from prison visits to helping U.S. Citizen parents transmit citizenship to their foreign-born children. I\u2019m proud to say that I now speak Haitian-Creole very well.\nMy husband and our daughter and I have just arrived in Brunei in Southeast Asia, where we will be for the next two years. It\u2019s a small embassy here so I will sort of be in a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019 position working on political, economic, and consular issues.\n**Tell me about your Korean experience.**\nI lived in Korea back when I was in the Air Force. I loved living there; really, I love Asia in general, which is largely why we\u2019re back in Asia now. My husband and I actually met when we were both posted in Korea. We loved the culture and the people. We lived outside of Seoul, and we found that area to be so vibrant; an incredible juxtaposition of modern technology and traditional lifestyles and architecture. Six years after we met he took me back to Korea to propose and surprised me with engagement photos at one of our favorite locations up in Seoul!\n**What was living in Belgium like? What did you do for NATO?**\nI was also posted to Belgium, where I worked as an intelligence analyst at Supreme Headquarters Allied Power Europe (SHAPE), which in simple terms is NATO military headquarters\nFollowing that, I was deployed multiple times while working for Air Force Special Operations Command. I had a deployment to Afghanistan and another based out of Stuttgart, Germany, which was focused primarily on work related to Africa. As you would expect, being deployed isn\u2019t easy; you\u2019re working 12+ hour days every day the whole time, so it\u2019s a pretty grueling pace. I guess it was good training for becoming a mom, haha. ****\nTimeline of Brittany\u2019s Journey:\n  1. UCI/UCLA/ROTC \u2013 graduated and commissioned in June 2015\n  2. Mitchell year in Ireland, 2005-2006\n  3. 2006-2010, active duty officer in the Air Force (training, Korea, Belgium/NATO)\n  4. 2010-2013, reservist in the Air Force (multiple deployments), I was also working for Booz Allen Hamilton in DC during this time, but we didn\u2019t really talk about that.\n  5. 2014-current, Foreign Service Officer (diplomat) with the State Department (training, Haiti, Brunei)\n\n\n**Now we have a one year old. She\u2019s our sweetie.**\n**What dreams do you have for her? What do you hope for her?**\nEveryone hopes that their child grows up with more opportunities that they had. My dad passed away when I was a kid. As simple as it sounds, l hope our daughter grows up with both of her parents. My husband and I have been actively trying to give her the gift of language because neither of us grew up bilingual. Her first language was actually Creole.\n**If I were to ask you now for final words of advice for students contemplating the Mitchell what would you say to them?**\nI would say, just apply. I applied for many scholarships that I did not receive. But I would say that going through these experiences prepared me for the next opportunities. I think many times we are afraid of risking failure. But life, ultimately, is experiences. Everything is meant to prepare you for the next thing and to make you a stronger person. Even if you don\u2019t make it all the way, do it for the experience. I just don\u2019t think you can go wrong with applying for a prestigious scholarship. You\u2019ll always have that experience to draw from in the future.\n****\n## Related Posts\n##  [Alexander Alvara \u2013 Fulbright Recipient](https://scholars.uci.edu/2020/02/13/alexander-alvara-fulbright-recipient/)\nFeb 13, 2020\nAlexander Alvara (Fulbright 2017) Alexander is a recent alumni who triple-majored in Mechanical, Aerospace, and...\n##  [Mohamad Abedi\u2013NSF Winner and SOROS Fellow](https://scholars.uci.edu/2017/01/16/mohamad-abedi-nsf-winner-and-soros-fellow/)\nJan 16, 2017\nMohamad Abedi-Dinner with the Soros Fellows and President Barack Obama Mohamad was born to Palestinian refugees in the...\n##  [Kenneth Lai-Fulbright Recipient and Marshall Finalist](https://scholars.uci.edu/2017/01/15/kenneth-lai-fulbright-recipient-marshall-finalist/)\nJan 15, 2017\nFulbrighters in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Kenneth Lai graduated from UCI magna cum laude in 2014 with a B.A. in English Literature and...\n",

    "content": "# Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans\n### About\nThe [Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans](https://www.pdsoros.org/) is a $90,000 merit-based fellowship exclusively for immigrants and children of immigrants who are pursuing graduate school in the United States. Paul and Daisy Soros, Hungarian immigrants and American philanthropists, created the program as a way to give back to the country that had afforded their family such great opportunities.\nMr. and Mrs. Soros decided on a fellowship program because it allowed them to assist young New Americans at critical points in their educations, which they felt was an unmet need. They also wished to call attention to the extensive and diverse contributions of New Americans to the quality of life in the United States.\n### Fields of Study\nEach Soros Fellowship supports one to two years of graduate study in any field and in any advanced degree-granting program in the United States. Ineligible programs: Online programs, executive graduate programs, joint bachelors/master\u2019s programs in which both degrees are awarded simultaneously, certificate programs, post-baccalaureate programs, graduate programs that are not in the United States, and graduate programs that are not fully accredited.\nPaul & Daisy Soros Fellows have pursued careers in medicine, science, law, policy, technology, business, government, non-profits, the arts, academia, and, in many cases, they have built their career across several sectors.\n### Eligibility\n**New American Status:** To be eligible, your birth parents must have both been born outside of the US as non-US citizens, and both parents must not have been eligible for US citizenship at the time of their births.* In addition, one of the following must be true of you on the national application deadline:\n  * Born in the US: You are a US citizen by birth and both of your parents were born abroad as non-US citizens.\n  * Born abroad: \n    * Naturalized Citizen: You have been naturalized as a US citizen either on your own or as a minor child under the application of one of your parents.\n    * Adopted: You were born outside of the US or one of its territories and were subsequently adopted by American parents and were awarded US citizenship because of your adoption.\n    * Green Card: You are in possession of a valid green card.\n    * Refugee & Asylee: You have been granted asylum or refugee status in the US.\n    * If None of the Other Categories Above Apply: Graduated from High School and College in the US: If none of the other categories apply to you and you were born abroad but graduated from both high school and college in the US (this includes current and past DACA recipients).\n  * * If you were raised by only one of your birth parents, the following must be true: \n    * The parent who raised you must have been born abroad as a non-US citizen.\n    * Your second birth parent was not part of your life growing up and you have no contact with them.\n\n\n**Academic Standing:** SOP advises currently enrolled juniors (intending to graduate next academic year); graduating seniors (in the current academic year); and recent alumni (who graduated within the most recent academic year). If you are still in college studying for your first bachelor\u2019s degree, you are eligible to apply as long as you will complete your first bachelor\u2019s degree before you enroll as a graduate student\n**Age:** All students must be aged 30 or younger as of the national application deadline.\n### Scholarship Benefits\nEach award is for up to a total of $90,000, including $25,000 in stipend support per year and 50 percent of required tuition and fees, up to $20,000 per year, for one to two years. The first year of Fellowship funding cannot be deferred.\nOver the two years of the Fellowship, Fellows are required to attend the annual Fall Conference in New York City, which is fully paid for by the program. The Fall Conference takes place over a weekend in late October and is an opportunity for the new Fellows to get to know one another and the Fellowship staff, alumni, and community, celebrate, and examine the New American experience.\nIn addition, the director or deputy director of the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships will visit each Fellow on their respective campus during the first fall semester of their Fellowship. The Fellowship funding should allow Fellows to focus on their studies full-time, which is why Fellows are not able to work full-time during their graduate program.\nMost importantly, new Fellows join a strong community of current and past Fellows who all share the New American experience. An alumni association, [The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellows Association (PDSFA)](https://www.pdsoros.org/fellowship/pdsfa), actively engages current and past Fellows in events held across the country. Each Fellow attends two weekend conferences of Fellows. The great majority continue to be involved with the program through regional dinners and service in the selection process for later classes.\n### Recent Recipients & Alternates\nUCI has had five recipients of the Soros Fellowship:\n  * Mohamad Abedi, Biomedical Engineering (2015 Scholar);\n  * Carolina Gabriela Jauregi, English & Comparative Literature (2007 Scholar);\n  * Dora Castaneda Rodriguez, Biological Sciences (2006 Scholar);\n  * Erick Ruiz Miranda, Biology (2002 Scholar);\n  * Mia Ching Lee, History (2000 Scholar).\n\n\n### Competitiveness\nThe program draws more than 2,200 applications annually for just 30 fellowships.\nSelection is based on merit \u2013 the specific [selection criteria](https://www.pdsoros.org/apply/criteria) emphasize creativity, originality, initiative and sustained accomplishment. The rigorous selection process is focused on identifying the most promising New Americans who are poised to make significant contributions to the nation through their work. There should be a clear connection between the proposed graduate degree program and your long-term, ambitious career goals. In addition, the selection team looks for a commitment to the United States\u2019 fundamental principles and ideals.\n## Related Posts\n[Knight-Hennessy Scholarship at Stanford University](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/knight-hennessy-scholarship-at-stanford-university/)\n##  [Knight-Hennessy Scholarship at Stanford University](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/knight-hennessy-scholarship-at-stanford-university/)\nMay 25, 2022\nAbout The Knight-Hennessy Scholars program cultivates a diverse, multidisciplinary community of emerging leaders from...\n[Harry S.

Early last year, I was truly shocked and honored to be named a 2009 Goldwater Scholar.\nIn fact, my first exposure to research and academia actually happened right here at UCI back when I was a Junior at University High School. I had the wonderful opportunity to participate in the American Cancer Society\u2019s Youth Summer Science Fellowship program, where I worked in the School of Medicine in UCI\u2019s Department of Epidemiology and the Cancer Research Institute conducting breast cancer research. The experience was one of a kind and it opened my eyes to the world of academia and the ongoing biomedical research efforts that I believe, in the upcoming years, will yield great knowledge, novel diagnostic tools, treatments, and even cures for those who live their lives suffering with devastating illness. We are very lucky to have a research university that has such fantastic opportunities to learn and to ask questions about the things that interest us, and I think my early experiences here at UCI guided the research opportunities I later pursued as an undergraduate at the UCI School of Medicine in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology.\nI have learned and continue to learn so much, and my experiences have only fueled my interest in medical research. I am very excited for this upcoming year for so many reasons, and there is so much to look forward to!

    "content": "# Alexander Alvara \u2013 Fulbright Recipient\n[](https://scholars.uci.edu/files/2020/02/Alvara-Alexander.png)\n### Alexander Alvara (Fulbright 2017)\nAlexander is a recent alumni who triple-majored in Mechanical, Aerospace, and Materials Science Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering and Business. His research includes development of a carbon fiber unmanned drone, a user-controlled prosthetic hand, a mobile phone compatible spectrometer, and an \u201cexosuit\u201d for shoulder and bicep rehabilitation. Alexander was a mentor for the Office of Access and Inclusion and is now a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley in Mechanical Engineering researching condensed matter physics, high-energy nanotechnologies, and space systems. Alexander is also a recipient of the National GEM Consortium Ph.D. Fellowship, NSF CRFP Honorable Mention, and the Berkeley Chancellors Fellowship. In 2017, Alexander received a Fulbright U.S. Student Program award to research medical robotics and develop pediatric surgical robots for bone biopsy and neurosurgery applications at the University of Toronto in collaboration with The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and Engineering Services Inc., a precision robotics company.\nRecently, the SOP office conducted an interview with Alexander, and provided below are his responses about the application process and tips for future applicants:\n* * *\n**What did you learn about yourself during the scholarship application process?**\nDuring the application process, I learned a lot about asking for help around the campus\u2026 I learned I didn\u2019t know my campus as I thought I did. I had been around and I tried to make it my duty to really know what resources were available to me. But, obviously, I didn\u2019t do that great of a job. Because the Scholarship Opportunities Program was a huge help to me and I just found out through chance by walking by one of their workshops. \nAnd the second most important thing that I learned was I may not be the best storyteller when it comes to myself. I can talk about research, I can talk about other things, but that was really a big hurdle for me, learning how to talk about myself during the application.\n* * *\n**What are the biggest benefits of working with SOP?**\nSo, the biggest benefit of working with the SOP, was that they had a lot of hands-on help. The fact that they offer so much help and so much feedback was actually a huge, huge factor for me. They helped me through at least 20 revisions and helped me whittle away the problem I mentioned earlier of not being able to talk about myself. They really helped me to grow and develop my writing style and had it not been without them, I am not sure that I would have gotten the scholarship. I went through like 20 revisions of my application, and the strongest ones were usually from, interestingly enough, the strongest revisions came from the non-technical side because it had to be readable for the general audience.

There are two main types of Fulbright scholarships:\n  * Study/Research supports one academic year of specialized study, independent research, or creative arts project (available in approximately [140 countries](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/regions)).\n  * English Teaching Assistantships (ETAs) support one academic year of teaching experience (available in approximately [80 countries](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/types-of-awards/english-teaching-assistant-awards)).\n\n\n**Eligibility**\nBecause the Fulbright U.S. Student Program is administered through the U.S. Department of State, the program is restricted to U.S. Citizens. You must finish your bachelor\u2019s degree before travel abroad through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. However, you do NOT need to have earned a bachelor\u2019s degree by the time you apply.\nCampus endorsement (nomination) is  _required_ for enrolled juniors, and  _optional_ for graduating seniors and recent alumni within 1 year of graduation. The typical applicant is an undergraduate junior, beginning the advising process one year before graduation. Seniors or alumni within 1 year of graduation are provided advising services on a space-available basis.\nPlease note that external scholarship agencies will consider all of your credit-bearing coursework from any college or institution as part of the review process (including CSU, community colleges, private colleges or other UC campuses/Extension programs, and including units earned while in high school). Grades from other colleges will be included in calculation of your overall GPA for eligibility purposes.\nThe scholarship does not stipulate a minimum GPA. However, to be competitive, SOP advisors recommend that applicants achieve at least a 3.5 GPA and demonstrate a strong record of experience related to the selected grant type and proposed project. Relevant qualifications may include 1 or more years of leadership or mentoring roles in academic, extracurricular, or service organizations; research experience or publications (especially for Study/Research); tutoring or teaching experience (especially for ETAs); arts exhibits or performances (especially for creative projects); and/or significant work experience/internships.\nStudy/Research applicants who plan to apply to a country where English is not the primary language should have sufficient proficiency in the local language to carry out their proposed study, and must submit a [Foreign Language Evaluation](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/instructions-for-foreign-language-evaluators) confirming these skills. Some countries may establish higher levels of expected proficiency, which will be noted in the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/regions).\nOdds of winning are improved by applying to countries with [comparatively low ratios of applicants to slots](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/statistics); in particular, consider destinations other than the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.\nIndividuals who have studied abroad in a university program are considered to be desirable candidates, but those who have lived or worked abroad (outside of formal study abroad programs) are encouraged to apply to a host country where they have not yet lived. Since Fulbright is an international exchange program, apply to a country where you would not yet be considered \u201ca cultural insider.\u201d\n_UCI graduate students: As our office supports undergraduates, please contact the[Graduate Resource Center](https://www.grad.uci.edu/services/grc/index.php) for graduate fellowship advising services._\n_UCI faculty: As our office supports undergraduates, we are not able to provide advising to[Fulbright Scholar Program](https://www.cies.org/) applicants. Please contact the [Office of Global Engagement](http://global.uci.edu/) for assistance with international travel and collaborative agreements, and the [Office of Research](https://research.uci.edu/) for grant-writing guidance._\n_International graduate students and researchers: Please contact your home country\u2019s[Foreign Fulbright Program](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/) administration for more information. Please note that our office does not provide advising to Foreign Fulbright applicants. The [Office of Global Engagement](http://global.uci.edu/) may assist with letters of invitation for foreign students or researchers._\n**Application Process  \n**\nTo begin the SOP advising process, complete a [Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/). In April and May, SOP staff review Pre-Applications and meet with potential applicants to discuss their candidacy and subsequent steps.\nSOP has limited advising capacity and prioritizes currently enrolled undergraduates and highly competitive candidates in our optional advising process. If you are a graduating senior and miss SOP\u2019s Pre-Application deadline, or if it has been more than 1 year since your graduation from UCI, please apply directly to the [Fulbright U.S. Student Program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/).\nAfter completing the Pre-App and meeting with SOP staff to discuss your candidacy, you will work on drafts of your application and receive strategic coaching from SOP staff. The electronic application typically includes an application form, 3 letters of recommendation, transcripts, and 2 essays. Study/research candidates also submit a minimum of 1 [letter of affiliation](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/applicants/application-tips/academic) from their desired host university or organization. Creative and performing arts applicants also submit a [supplementary materials portfolio](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/required-supplementary-materials-for-arts-applicants) in the form and genre they propose to study.\nSOP staff will also provide guidance to your recommendation letter writers.\n  * Study/Research grants require **three letters of recommendation** from individuals (especially professors or research mentors) who can confirm your strengths in your proposed field of study or research.\n  * English Teaching Assistantships require **[three ETA reference forms](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/instructions-for-eta-recommendation-writers)** from individuals who can confirm your abilities to teach, tutor, and/or mentor youth in the English language.\n\n\nThe UCI Fulbright committee will interview candidates in August to determine whether their applications have earned campus endorsement (nomination) and will offer feedback for refining the application. SOP staff and the office of the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education will write comprehensive nomination letters for each endorsed candidate and will send your complete application materials (including reference letters) and the nomination letter to the Fulbright program in advance of the October national deadline.\nSemi-finalists will be notified in early Winter Quarter, and winners are announced in Spring Quarter on a country-by-country basis.\n**Degrees Funded**\nEnglish Teaching Assistantships support one academic year of teaching experience abroad, whereas Study/Research grants fund one academic year of of graduate or specialized study, independent research, or creative arts project. Some Fulbright countries offer binational business internships, journalism & communications grants, science and public-health specific grants, or graduate degree awards. As these options frequently change, please see the [field-specific awards list](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/types-of-awards/study-research) on the Fulbright U.S. Student Program website for details.\n**Recent Recipients and Selection Procedures**\nAs of 2019, UCI has had 67 undergraduate and recent alumni Fulbright U.S. Student Program grant recipients. Read about recent recipients and semi-finalists on our [Fulbright Recipients](http://scholars.uci.edu/scholarship-recipients/) page.\nIn 2018-19, Madeleine Hart and Joyce Nguy received Fulbright grants. No Semi-Finalists or Alternates were named.\nIn 2017-18, Julianna Cressman, Aya Labanieh, and Priya Sri-Tharan were named Semi-Finalists; Shashank Somasundaram, Angela Romea, Sarah Shiori Mahoney, and Blaine Valencia were named Alternates (waitlisted); and Madeline Collins and Leanne Lupone received Fulbright grants.\nIn 2016-17, Tala Piriouzian and Tiffany Thompson were selected as Semi-Finalists; Joshua Cook was selected as an Alternate; and Alexander Alvara, Daniela Estrada, and Amy He received Fulbright grants.\nIn 2016, Christopher Galeano, Rosemary Gomez, Brennan Lagman, Ricardo Light, Paul Lowood, and Nayiri Partamian were selected as Semi-Finalists. Medha Asthana was selected as an Alternate. Tala Pirouzian was selected as a Finalist, but the host country program was cancelled due to political unrest. Sara Arellano, Emma Austin, Sunny Liu, and Stella Liu received Fulbright grants.\nFulbright U.S. Fulbright Program grant recipients have strong academic records, good language preparation for the country intended, and a feasible project plan. They make a persuasive case for why they would benefit from study in a particular country and/or at a particular university, and articulate a passion for positive cross-cultural exchange.\nSemi-finalists will be notified in early Winter Quarter, and winners are announced in Spring Quarter on a country-by-country basis.\n**Finances**  \nTotal value of the award varies by country. Grants generally provide round-trip transportation, language or orientation courses (where appropriate), tuition, books, maintenance for the academic year based on living costs in the host country, and health and accident insurance. Specific information concerning finances for each country is described in the [host country summary](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/regions) and/or posted on the local Fulbright Commission website.\n**Comments**  \nFulbrights are prestigious, career-enhancing awards. They also confer special status on winners during their year of foreign study, as outstanding, officially recognized representatives of their country. Famous Fulbright recipients include Thomas Pickering, John Lithgow, and Renee Fleming. At least 47 UCI faculty have also received Fulbright grants.\n**For More Information**  \nFurther information and applications are available on [the Fulbright U.S. Student Program website](http://us.fulbrightonline.org/).\n**Access the[Big 10 Pre-Application](http://scholars.uci.edu/big-10-pre-application-information/) between late February \u2013 early April annually to begin the application process.**\n**SOP is able to advise competitive undergraduate candidates at UC Irvine only.**\n  * \n\n## Related Posts\n[Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\n##  [Udall Undergraduate Scholarship](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/01/05/udall-undergraduate-scholarship/)\nJan 5, 2022\nUCI (Big 7 Pre-Application) Mandatory Advising Deadline: November 14, 2019 at 12:00 noon Pacific Time for Fall 2020...\n[The Harry S.

    "content": "# George Mitchell Scholarship (Ireland)\n### About\nThe [George J. Mitchell Scholarship](https://www.us-irelandalliance.org/mitchellscholarship) Program is a nationally competitive award for U.S. citizens sponsored by the US-Ireland Alliance. Named in honor of the former U.S. Senator\u2019s pivotal contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process, the Mitchell Scholarship is designed to introduce and connect future American leaders to the island of Ireland, while recognizing and fostering academic excellence, leadership, and a commitment to public service. \nStarting with the program\u2019s inaugural Class of 2001, each Scholar has exemplified the characteristics of scholarship, leadership, and commitment to community and public service that are hallmarks of Senator Mitchell\u2019s own selfless dedication and legacy.\nAs important as the relationship between the US and Ireland are the relationships between and among Mitchell Scholars. Following the Mitchell year, Scholars are expected to participate as active alums of the program. Becoming a Mitchell Scholar means joining a community of Scholars who are committed to a continuing relationship with the Mitchell community, the US-Ireland Alliance, and the island of Ireland.\n### Fields of Study\nThe Mitchell Scholarship places no limitations on your undergraduate major or field of study.\nA Mitchell Scholar may study any academic discipline offered in a degree or certificate program at an institution of higher learning in Ireland or Northern Ireland. The wide range of academic interests among Scholars \u2014 from computer science to biotechnology to international relations to economics to theater \u2014 illustrates the vast opportunities for post-graduate study available on the island.\nMitchell Scholars may study or conduct research at the graduate level at eleven institutions of higher learning on the island of Ireland. This includes the seven universities in the Republic of Ireland, two institutes in Dublin, and two universities in Northern Ireland (Queen\u2019s University Belfast and the Ulster University). Since the Mitchell Scholarship Program provides funding for one year, Scholars normally enroll in one-year master\u2019s degree (or similar) programs.\nEach applicant is responsible for doing the research necessary to identify university preferences. Applicants should examine university websites and may want to consult with department chairs, faculty, or registrars at the universities in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Faculty and fellowship offices at an applicant\u2019s current college or university may also provide guidance. An applicant must have the requisite undergraduate background for the proposed program. Applicants should carefully research prospective programs to determine the required period of residence; some master\u2019s programs require two years of study, and the Mitchell Scholarship Program provides only one year of support.\nReview the detailed information on the Mitchell website under [Institutions in Ireland](https://www.us-irelandalliance.org/mitchellscholarship/applicants/institutions) to learn more about the Irish university system and available options.\n### Eligibility\nTo be eligible for SOP advising services on a Mitchell application, an undergraduate student (or recent undergraduate alumni) must:\n  * be a junior (intending to graduate next academic year), a graduating senior (intending to graduate in the current academic year) or a recent undergraduate degree recipient from UCI within the past 12 months*;\n  * be a citizen of the United States;\n  * be at least 18 years of age but not yet 30 on the national application deadline in late September/early October of each year;\n  * intend to begin enrollment in a graduate program exactly **two Fall terms in the future**(not in the upcoming Fall term of the calendar year of application).\n\n\n### Scholarship Benefits\nThe Mitchell Scholarship Program provides:\n  * full tuition for 9 to 12 months of study;\n  * housing (on-campus, when available);\n  * a monthly living stipend (currently $1250 USD) for up to 12 months of post-graduate academic study on the island;\n  * One round-trip airline ticket between the United States and Ireland is also provided and booked directly by the US-Ireland Alliance.\n\n\nEach Mitchell Scholar is responsible for securing and financing his or her own health insurance while abroad.\nThree events are mandatory for each Mitchell Scholar: a September orientation (usually held in Dublin), a mid-year retreat (usually held in Northern Ireland), and commencement in May (somewhere on the island \u2014 it changes each year). The Mitchell Scholarship covers hotel expenses for these obligatory events, but the Scholars are expected to use the stipend to cover their travel and any incidentals. There are also optional but highly recommended gatherings, such as Thanksgiving dinner in Dublin and a trip to Glenstal Abbey.\n### Recent Recipients and Finalists\n[Brittany Schick](https://sites.uci.edu/sop/2017/06/07/brittany-schick-george-mitchell-scholarship-winner/), UCI\u2019s first Mitchell Scholar, received bachelor\u2019s degrees in Political Science and International Studies in 2005. As a Mitchell Scholar, she pursued a master\u2019s degree in international security and conflict studies at Dublin City University.\n### Competitiveness\nHighly competitive, the Mitchell Scholarship receives over 300 applications per year in the national competition for 12 scholarships.\nEndorsed (nominated) applications from campuses are submitted to the U.S.-Ireland Alliance for national-level consideration, and candidates complete a brief video interview after the national deadline. Semi-finalists are typically invited to Washington, D.C. for an in-person interview in November before the final selection committee.\nProspective scholars must have demonstrated a record of intellectual distinction, leadership, and extracurricular activity, as well as personal characteristics of honesty, integrity, fairness, and unselfish service to others that indicates a potential future for leadership and contribution to society. It is envisaged that the Mitchell Scholars will not only explore the island of Ireland, but also develop an understanding of the relationship between Ireland and Britain as well as Ireland\u2019s relationship with Europe.\nSOP recommends earning at least a 3.7+ G.P.A. and curating a record of original and significant accomplishment in your discipline (such as presentations, publications, exhibits, or performances), as well as a record of significant leadership achievement in campus or off-campus organizations, before applying to the Mitchell Scholarship. Most recent recipients of similarly competitive awards, such as Marshall, participated in the [Campuswide Honors Collegium](http://honors.uci.edu/) and/or the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://www.urop.uci.edu/) and were also competitive for invitation to School-based Honors Programs.\n## Related Posts\n[Schwarzman Scholarship \\(Tsingua University, China\\)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\n##  [Schwarzman Scholarship (Tsingua University, China)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/05/25/schwarzman-scholarship-tsingua-university-china/)\nMay 25, 2022\nDesigned to prepare young leaders to deepen understanding between China and the rest of the world, Schwarzman Scholars is the first scholarship created to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st Century.

    "content": "# Cristian Martinez: NSEP/Boren Recipient, 2009 (Brazil)\nCristian next to the famous Christ Statue in Rio de Janeiro\nI have made impressive progress with my language skills and I have definitely met my goal to have colloquial fluency. There is really no comparison between the language study I have had abroad to the one I had at UC Irvine. When you study a language overseas, you never leave the classroom because the langauage is everwhere until you go to sleep. In addition, when studying in-country, the professors are locals and speak to you only in the language being learned. In the U.S., the professors cannot escape in the very least making comparisons to English. Studying in-country forces you to learn the language while trying to think in it too. The most significant difference in studying in-country is that you get outside of the classroom exposure when you go to restaurants, or on a walk, or simply to have coffee with your local friends and you practice it all the time. Thanks to my in-country experience, I can say I have become fluent in Portuguese in the span of six months.\nAside from taking advanced Portuguese as a course, I also took three other courses. I took Brazilian Foreign Policy, Process of Regional Integration and my Senior Thesis Research Course. These four courses (including the Portuguese course) add up to a total of 14 hours of class hours per week. The quality of instruction varies. The most challenging course with the highest quality of instruction was the Brazilian Foreign Policy course. However all courses had acceptable quality in instruction. It is also important to mention that all the coursework, with the exception of the Senior Thesis Research Course, were in Portuguese (literature, writing and lectures). I have also met my academic goals by taking this coursework. I have met three of my upper division requirements from my home institution by taking this course load.\nI participated in various extra-curricular activities. I joined a weight training course that was held twice a week to keep my body healthy. I also joined two non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These organizations included \u201cEducari\u201d and \u201cCollege Horizons.\u201d Educari works with elementry school children who live in the Vidigal favela (slum). I worked with the eight year-olds and taught them how to speak and write beginning level English. I will continue to work with these children for the second half of my study abroad program. I also worked with College Horizons where I mentored inter-city favela youth. These youth are interested in one day visiting the United States and pursuing a degree.\nI am experiencing the local culture by attending various cultural events that are held in the city. For example, I have attended various schools of Samba where I see firsthand their tradition of dancing samba and how that unites their people. I have also attended various soccer games since Brazilians love their soccer. I have also become a regular beach goer as that is a large part of their local culture as well. Aside from that, I experience their local culture when I go out for coffee or for dinner with my Brazilian friends and when I attend lectures and observe their way of studying and learning. Brazilian culture is so rich that you cannot help but to find it everywhere you go.\nI use my language skills about 80% of the time. I use my language skills while I am in class, at the beach, at home, and at any other public place and with my Brazilian friends.\nThe most enjoyable aspects of adjusting to the local culture is learning how there is a different way of living that works for a different set of people. Also adopting new traditions and habits that only make my own life richer, such as how to samba or cook a Brazilian meal. The challenging aspect of adjusting to the local culture is that unlike American culture, Brazilians prefer doing everything with others around rather than alone. And at times I wish I had some more privacy. But that is only a small challenge because I enjoy working with a crowd as well. What is also challenging is that they enjoy going out a lot and staying in is rather a weird concept for them. Sitting and reading a book indoors is odd for most Brazilians and that too is a challenge since I enjoy doing that once in a while.\nHolding the Brazilian Flag in Copacabana Beach\nI have enjoyed the most the new things I have learned. I have learned how to be more open to new enviroments, new ways of doing things and new ways of thinking about the concept of politics, family and society. I have learned a new langauge that I consider beautiful, interesting and enjoyably challenging. I have also gained new connections and friendships that make me a more well rounded global citizen. I also enjoy Brazil\u2019s music, beaches and the whole way of being.\nThere are few things that I do not like about my study abroad experience. The biggest being the large amount of crime and violence that exists in Rio de Janeiro. There is never a day that I feel safe walking down the streets of Rio. In addition, I do not like the social inequality and racism that still exists here in Rio and in Brazil in general. These negatives are what make me miss home the most where I don\u2019t have worry about how dark my skin is, or how much I am carrying in my pockets or whether I can find others whom I can associate with that are of the same socio-economic status as me.\n## Related Posts\n##  [Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/09/08/katie-farrar-fulbright-2009-italy-2/)\nSep 8, 2022\n2nd entry: On February 12, 2010, I witnessed the first snowfall to blanket Rome since February 1986 (oddly enough,...\n##  [Katie Farrar: Fulbright 2009 (Italy)](https://scholars.uci.edu/2022/09/08/katie-farrar-fulbright-2009-italy/)\nSep 8, 2022\n1st entry: It is difficult to put into words the sense of awe I feel daily living in Rome.
